// PlateauState is a rolling window of fitness deltas used to detect when
// the outer Dream loop has stopped making meaningful progress.
//
// Observe fires only when K consecutive |delta| values all fall below
// epsilon. A single out-of-window sample clears the streak and forces
// the state machine to accumulate K fresh sub-epsilon observations
// before it will fire. This absorbs a single noisy iteration by design
// — see pm-FEAS-08 in the pre-mortem for the rationale (we would
// rather spend one extra iteration than halt on a transient wobble).
//
// PlateauState is not safe for concurrent use. The outer loop runs
// sequentially so a mutex would be pure overhead.
