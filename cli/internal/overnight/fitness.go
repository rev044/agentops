// Source-agnostic: any producer (corpus.FitnessVector, ao goals measure,

// metric names, so adding or removing metrics between iterations is
// handled explicitly in Delta.

	// Previous is the prior snapshot's value for this metric.

	// Current is the latest snapshot's value for this metric. A missing
	// key in the current snapshot is treated as 0 for the comparison and
	// yields a full-value drop.

// Delta returns the composite delta between this snapshot and prev, the
// list of metrics whose drop exceeded their per-metric floor, and a bool
// flag set iff regressions is non-empty.
//
// The composite is the arithmetic mean of per-metric (curr - prev)
// contributions — positive means "got better", negative means "got
// worse". Each unique key across both snapshots contributes exactly
// once:
//
//   - Metrics present in both: (curr - prev) is added to the composite;
//     if (prev - curr) > floor, the metric is also flagged as a
//     regression.
//   - Metrics present in prev but missing in curr: counted as a full
//     drop of size prev. The contribution to the composite is -prev. If
//     prev > floor the metric is flagged.
//   - Metrics present in curr but missing in prev: counted as a full
//     gain of +curr with no regression.
//
// floors is an optional per-metric override map; metrics without an
// entry fall back to defaultFloor. Callers supplying a zero or negative
// defaultFloor get DefaultRegressionFloor substituted transparently.
//
// A nil prev short-circuits to (0, nil, false): the first iteration has
// nothing to compare against and is therefore never considered
// regressed. Map iteration is done in sorted key order so the returned
// regression slice and composite computation are fully deterministic.
