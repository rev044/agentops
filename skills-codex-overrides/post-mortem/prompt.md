# post-mortem

Close out completed work in a Codex-native way: validate outcomes, extract durable learnings, and harvest concrete follow-up work back into the queue.

## Codex Execution Profile

1. Treat `skills/post-mortem/SKILL.md` as the canonical close-out contract and `skills-codex/post-mortem/SKILL.md` as the Codex-facing artifact.
2. Keep the council/validation summary concise, then write learnings and harvested work to disk.
3. Prefer concrete follow-up items that can flow directly into `.agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl` for the next Codex loop.

## Guardrails

1. Keep harvested work machine-checkable: available on write, then claim/release/consume through the queue lifecycle.
2. Count resolution per item, not per batch entry, when reporting prior findings.
3. Preserve evidence and source links so the next Codex cycle can act without re-deriving context.
4. Finish Codex closeout with `ao codex stop`, and recommend `ao codex status` when the user needs to confirm lifecycle health.
5. If a Codex-native override and the source skill diverge, keep behavior aligned with the source contract and then update the override.
