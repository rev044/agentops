# AgentOps — One-Page Brief

**The problem:** AI coding tools behave like contractors with amnesia. Every session starts from zero — no memory of what broke last week, no record of decisions already made, no awareness of what was tried and abandoned. You brief them today. Tomorrow you brief them again.

---

## What It Is

A repo-native operating layer for stateless coding agents.

AgentOps gives every session a mission, a phased workflow, quality gates, and a durable memory substrate on disk. Work begins with repo context instead of a blank prompt, passes through explicit plan and code judgment, and ends by feeding findings, learnings, and next work back into the environment.

The institutional knowledge stops walking out the door because the repo keeps it.

---

## Four Load-Bearing Layers

### Skills — The Orchestration Layer
Structured workflows for discovery, execution, validation, recovery, and release. Skills route work into the right primitive chain instead of leaving the agent to improvise the lifecycle.

### Hooks — The Enforcement Layer
Runtime hooks fire at session start/end, prompt submission, tool boundaries, stop, and task completion. They keep guidance, validation, and loop closure active even when the operator does not remember every step.

### `ao` CLI — The Retrieval and Ratchet Layer
The CLI handles retrieval, ratchet checkpoints, flywheel closure, goals, curation, and phased execution support. It is the mechanical bridge between plain files, workflows, and enforceable progress.

### `.agents/` — The Stigmergic Memory Layer
Plain files on disk: research, brainstorms, findings, learnings, handoffs, ratchet traces, next-work queues. No single session has to remember the plan. The environment carries it forward.

## How a Session Works

```
Session starts
  -> Startup hooks retrieve lightweight context and continuity hints
  -> Discovery scopes the work and pressure-tests the plan

Implementation runs
  -> Fresh workers execute in bounded waves
  -> Validation gates challenge the output before closure

Session ends
  -> Learnings, findings, and next work are harvested
  -> Flywheel closure updates what the next session will see

Next session starts with a richer environment than this one did.
```

## Key Properties

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Local-only** | No telemetry, no cloud, no vendor accounts. Nothing phones home. |
| **Open source** | Every line auditable. Apache 2.0 licensed. |
| **Multi-tool** | Works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode. Not locked to one vendor. |
| **Air-gap compatible** | Runs fully offline. Knowledge base is plain files. |
| **Auditable trail** | Every learning, decision, and review verdict written to `.agents/` with timestamps. |

---

## The Compound Effect

```
Without AgentOps:  [2 hrs] → [2 hrs] → [2 hrs] → [2 hrs]  =  8 hours total
With AgentOps:     [2 hrs] → [10 min] → [2 min] → instant  =  ~2.2 hours total
                    learn     recall     refine    mastered
```

By session 100, the repo already carries prior failures, design choices, planning rules, and validated patterns that new sessions can load before they repeat old mistakes.

---

## Development Model

The most accurate current framing is:

```text
12-Factor AgentOps -> operating conditions
Stigmergic Spiral -> macro lifecycle for stateless builders
Brownian Ratchet -> chaos filtered into locked progress
Knowledge Flywheel -> durable learning and loop closure
```

The claim is not "better models." The claim is "better repo mechanics around the models you already have."

### The Pipeline — Primitive Chains in Motion

`/rpi` orchestrates the macro lifecycle. Each phase expands into its own skill chain.

```
GOALS.md
  -> /evolve
      -> /rpi
          -> Discovery: /brainstorm -> /research -> /plan -> /pre-mortem
          -> Implementation: /crank -> /swarm -> /implement
          -> Validation: /validation -> /vibe -> /post-mortem -> /retro -> /forge
```

### Judgment Layer — Everything Flows Through Council
