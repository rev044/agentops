# AgentOps — One-Page Brief

**The problem:** AI coding tools behave like contractors with amnesia. Every session starts from zero — no memory of what broke last week, no record of decisions already made, no awareness of what was tried and abandoned. You brief them today. Tomorrow you brief them again.

---

## What It Is

A repo-native operational layer for coding agents.

AgentOps gives every session bookkeeping, validation, primitives, and flows. Work begins with repo context instead of a blank prompt, passes through explicit validation before shipping, and ends by feeding findings, learnings, and next work back into the environment.

The institutional knowledge stops walking out the door because the repo keeps it.

---

## Internal Proof Contract

Most coding-agent tooling handles prompt construction and routing well. The failure mode comes after that. Internally, AgentOps proves the product through a three-gap lifecycle contract (see [docs/context-lifecycle.md](context-lifecycle.md)):

| Gap | Problem | AgentOps response |
|-----|---------|-------------------|
| **Validation** (internal: judgment validation) | The agent ships without risk context that would challenge its choices | `/pre-mortem` before implementation, `/vibe` before commit, `/council` for multi-judge review |
| **Bookkeeping** (internal: durable learning) | Solved problems recur because nothing extracts, scores, or retrieves the lesson | `.agents/` ledger, `ao lookup`, finding registry, `/retro` extraction, freshness curation |
| **Closure** (internal: loop closure) | Completed work does not produce better next work | `/post-mortem` harvests learnings and next-work, finding compiler promotes failures into constraints, `GOALS.md` + `/evolve` turn findings into measurable improvements |

The compound effect below only works because validation catches the problem,
bookkeeping preserves the lesson, and closure ensures the next session loads
better context before repeating the mistake.

## Four Load-Bearing Layers

### Skills — The Primitive and Flow Layer
Structured primitives and named flows for discovery, execution, validation, recovery, and release. Skills route work into the right chain instead of leaving the agent to improvise the lifecycle.

### Hooks — The Enforcement Layer
Runtime hooks fire at session start/end, prompt submission, tool boundaries,
stop, and task completion. They keep guidance, validation, and flywheel
closure active even when the operator does not remember every step.

### `ao` CLI — The Control Plane
The CLI handles retrieval, ratchet checkpoints, flywheel closure, goals, curation, and phased execution support. It is the mechanical bridge between plain files, flows, and enforceable progress.

### `.agents/` — The Bookkeeping Layer
Plain files on disk: research, brainstorms, findings, learnings, handoffs, ratchet traces, next-work queues. No single session has to remember the plan. The environment carries it forward.

---

## How a Session Works

```
Session starts
  -> Startup hooks retrieve lightweight context and continuity hints
  -> Discovery scopes the work and pressure-tests the plan

Implementation runs
  -> Fresh workers execute in bounded waves
  -> Validation gates challenge the output before closure

Session ends
  -> Learnings, findings, and next work are harvested
  -> Flywheel closure updates what the next session will see

Next session starts with a richer environment than this one did.
```

## Key Properties

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Local-only** | No telemetry, no cloud, no vendor accounts. Nothing phones home. |
| **Open source** | Every line auditable. Apache 2.0 licensed. |
| **Multi-tool** | Works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode. Not locked to one vendor. |
| **Air-gap compatible** | Runs fully offline. Knowledge base is plain files. |
| **Auditable trail** | Every learning, decision, and review verdict written to `.agents/` with timestamps. |

## The Compound Effect

```
Without AgentOps:  [2 hrs] → [2 hrs] → [2 hrs] → [2 hrs]  =  8 hours total
With AgentOps:     [2 hrs] → [10 min] → [2 min] → instant  =  ~2.2 hours total
                    learn     recall     refine    mastered
```

By session 100, the repo already carries prior failures, design choices, planning rules, and validated patterns that new sessions can load before they repeat old mistakes.

---

## Development Model

The most accurate current framing is:

```text
Public category    -> operational layer for coding agents
Public value       -> bookkeeping, validation, primitives, and flows
Internal proof     -> three-gap lifecycle contract
Technical frame    -> context compiler
Runtime mechanics  -> Brownian Ratchet + Stigmergic Spiral + Knowledge Flywheel
```

The claim is not "better models." The claim is "better repo mechanics around
the models you already have." Publicly, that means bookkeeping, validation,
primitives, and flows. Internally, the three-gap contract remains the proof
model that verifies those claims are real.

### The Pipeline — Primitive Chains in Motion

`/rpi` orchestrates the macro lifecycle. Each phase expands into its own skill chain.

```
GOALS.md
  -> /evolve
      -> /rpi
          -> Discovery: /brainstorm -> /research -> /plan -> /pre-mortem
          -> Implementation: /crank -> /swarm -> /implement
          -> Validation: /validation -> /vibe -> /post-mortem -> /retro -> /forge

### Validation Layer — Everything Flows Through Council
