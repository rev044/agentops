# Migration Tracker: os.Getwd() → resolveProjectDir()

**Status:** In Progress (5/N migrated)
**Started:** 2026-02-26 (Cycle 3)
**Pattern:** cli/cmd/ao/projectdir.go — resolveProjectDir()

## Why

Production code calls `os.Getwd()` directly, forcing tests to use `os.Chdir()` (process-global). This blocks `t.Parallel()` and makes the 46s test suite grow linearly with new tests.

`resolveProjectDir()` reads `testProjectDir` when set, allowing tests to override the directory without `os.Chdir`.

## Migration Approach

For each file, the standard migration is:

1. Replace `cwd, err := os.Getwd()` with `cwd, err := resolveProjectDir()`
2. For variant variable names (e.g. `dir`, `baseDir`, `baseCwd`, `origDir`), replace the full `os.Getwd()` call while preserving the variable name, e.g. `dir, err := resolveProjectDir()`
3. Remove the `os` import if no other `os.*` symbols are used in the file — check before removing
4. Update corresponding `_test.go` to set `testProjectDir` in a `t.Cleanup` instead of calling `os.Chdir`, where applicable

### Special cases

- **config.go** — uses `cwd, _ := os.Getwd()` (ignores error). Keep `_` pattern: `cwd, _ := resolveProjectDir()`
- **plans.go** — has both `cwd, err := os.Getwd()` and `cwd, _ := os.Getwd()` patterns; migrate each independently
- **rpi_phased.go** — line 95 has a comment explicitly mentioning `os.Getwd()` to explain an `os.Chdir` workaround; after migration this comment and the `os.Chdir` block should be re-evaluated

## Acceptance Criteria

- All production `os.Getwd()` calls in `cli/cmd/ao/*.go` (excluding `projectdir.go` itself) are replaced
- `grep -rn "os.Getwd" cli/cmd/ao/*.go | grep -v _test.go | grep -v "projectdir.go"` returns empty
- Tests can set `testProjectDir` in `t.Cleanup` instead of `os.Chdir`, enabling `t.Parallel()` across those tests
