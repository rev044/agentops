# AgentOps vs The Competition

> **TL;DR:** Most tools optimize *within* a session. AgentOps is the operational layer for coding agents: publicly an operational control layer, technically a context compiler that turns work into better future work.

## The Landscape (April 2026)

The AI coding agent ecosystem has exploded. Here's how the major players stack up:

| Tool | Focus | Strength | Gap AgentOps Fills |
|------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| [Superpowers](vs-superpowers.md) | TDD + Planning | Disciplined autonomous work, 6+ runtimes | No cross-session memory |
| [Claude-Flow / Ruflo](vs-claude-flow.md) | Multi-agent swarms | 54+ agents, WASM, 314 MCP tools | No learning mechanism |
| [SDD Tools](vs-sdd.md) | Spec-driven development | Industry standard (AWS Kiro, GitHub Spec Kit) | Specs only, no learnings |
| [GSD](vs-gsd.md) | Spec-driven execution | 53 commands, 7 runtimes, advisor mode | Ephemeral, no persistence |
| [Compound Engineer](vs-compound-engineer.md) | Plan/work/review/compound | Stack-aware routing, 10 runtimes | Manual compounding, no validation gates |

```

**Most other tools:** Make each session faster
**AgentOps:** Provide the operational layer that makes each session build on the last

Compound Engineer is the exception in this set: it also aims at compounding, but through a different workflow and persistence model.

## Quick Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Superpowers | Claude-Flow | SDD | GSD | Compound Engineer | AgentOps |
|---------|:-----------:|:-----------:|:---:|:---:|:-----------------:|:--------:|
| Planning workflow | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| TDD enforcement | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Multi-agent execution | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| Spec validation | ⚠️ | ❌ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ✅ |

## When to Use What

### Use Superpowers if:
- You want strict TDD enforcement
- Your codebase doesn't need cross-session context
- You're doing greenfield development

### Use Claude-Flow if:
- You need massive parallelization (60+ agents)
- Performance is critical (WASM optimization)
- You're building enterprise orchestration

### Use SDD (cc-sdd, spec-kit) if:
- You want spec-first development
- You work across multiple AI coding agents
- Documentation is your primary artifact

### Use GSD if:
- You want minimal overhead
- You're prototyping or shipping fast
- You don't need persistence

### Use Compound Engineer if:
- You want a clean `Plan -> Work -> Review -> Compound` loop
- You care about cross-tool sync and portability
- You want compounding, but with less AgentOps-specific machinery

### Use AgentOps if:
- You work on the same codebase repeatedly
- You want your agent to get smarter over time
- You value learning from past mistakes
- You want semantic validation (not just tests)
- You want failure prevention before building

## The Compounding Advantage

Over time, the gap widens:

- **Other tools:** Still taking the same time per task
- **AgentOps:** Domain expert with instant recall

## Can I Use Them Together?

**Yes, selectively:**

| Combination | Works? | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| AgentOps + Superpowers | ⚠️ | Overlapping planning; pick one |
| AgentOps + Claude-Flow | ✅ | Claude-Flow for orchestration, AgentOps for memory |
| AgentOps + SDD | ✅ | SDD for specs, AgentOps captures learnings |
| AgentOps + GSD | ⚠️ | GSD is lightweight; AgentOps adds overhead |
| AgentOps + Compound Engineer | ✅ | Compound Engineer for workflow shell, AgentOps for memory and validation |

The key: AgentOps' value is in the **knowledge layer**. If another tool handles execution better for your use case, AgentOps can still capture and compound the learnings.
