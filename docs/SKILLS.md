## Core Workflow Skills

### /research

Deep codebase exploration using Explore agents.

```bash
/research authentication flows in services/auth
```

**Output:** `.agents/research/<topic>.md`

### /plan

Decompose goals into trackable beads issues with dependencies.

```bash
/plan "Add user authentication with OAuth2"
```

**Output:** Beads issues with parent/child relationships

### /implement

Execute a single beads issue with full lifecycle.

```bash
/implement ap-1234
```

**Phases:** Context → Tests → Code → Validation → Commit

### /brainstorm

Structured idea exploration. Four phases: assess clarity, understand idea, explore approaches, capture design.

```bash
/brainstorm "add user authentication"
```

**Output:** `.agents/brainstorm/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`

### /rpi

Full RPI lifecycle orchestrator. Discovery → Implementation → Validation in one command.

```bash
/rpi "Add user authentication"
/rpi --fast-path "fix typo in README"
/rpi --from=implementation ag-1234
```

**Phases:** Discovery (research + plan + pre-mortem) → Implementation (crank) → Validation (vibe + post-mortem)

### /crank

Autonomous multi-issue execution. Runs until epic is CLOSED.

```bash
/crank <epic-id>
```

**Execution model:** Wave-based orchestration via `/swarm` with runtime-native workers.

### /vibe

Comprehensive code validation across 8 aspects with finding classification (CRITICAL vs INFORMATIONAL), suppression framework for known false positives, and domain-specific checklists (SQL safety, LLM trust boundary, race conditions) auto-loaded from `/standards`. Correlates findings against pre-mortem predictions.

```bash
/vibe services/auth/
```

**Checks:** Security, Quality, Architecture, Complexity, Testing, Accessibility, Performance, Documentation

### /retro

Quick-capture a learning. For full retrospectives, use `/post-mortem`.

```bash
/retro --quick "debugging memory leak"
```

**Output:** `.agents/learnings/`

### /post-mortem

Full validation + knowledge lifecycle. Council validates, extracts learnings, activates/retires knowledge, then synthesizes process improvement proposals and suggests the next `/rpi` command. The flywheel exit point. Now includes RPI session streak tracking, prediction accuracy scoring (HIT/MISS/SURPRISE against pre-mortem predictions), and persistent retro history to `.agents/retro/` for cross-epic trend analysis. Supports `--quick`, `--process-only`, and `--skip-activate` flags.

```bash
/post-mortem <epic-id>
/post-mortem --quick            # Lightweight post-mortem
/post-mortem --process-only     # Process improvements only
/post-mortem --skip-activate    # Skip knowledge activation
```

**Output:** Council report, learnings, knowledge activation/retirement, process improvement proposals, next-work queue (`.agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl`)

---

## Utility Skills

### /beads

Git-native issue tracking operations.

```bash
bd ready              # Unblocked issues
bd show <id>          # Issue details
bd close <id>         # Close issue
```

### /bug-hunt

Root cause analysis with git archaeology.

```bash
/bug-hunt "login fails after password reset"
```

### /knowledge

Query knowledge artifacts across locations.

```bash
/knowledge "patterns for rate limiting"
```

**Searches:** `.agents/learnings/`, `.agents/patterns/`, `.agents/research/`

### /complexity

Code complexity analysis using radon (Python) or gocyclo (Go).

```bash
/complexity services/
```

**Threshold:** CC > 10 triggers refactoring issue

### /doc

Generate documentation for code.

```bash
/doc services/auth/
```

### /pre-mortem

Simulate failures before implementing. Includes error/rescue mapping (tabular risk/mitigation), scope mode selection (Expand/Hold/Reduce with auto-detection), temporal interrogation (hour 1/2/4/6+ timeline), and prediction tracking with unique IDs (`pm-YYYYMMDD-NNN`) correlated through vibe and post-mortem.

```bash
/pre-mortem "add caching layer"
```

**Output:** Failure modes, error/rescue maps, predictions with IDs, mitigation strategies, spec improvements

---

## Orchestration Skills

### /council

Multi-model validation — the core primitive used by vibe, pre-mortem, and post-mortem. Auto-extracts significant findings from WARN/FAIL verdicts into the knowledge flywheel.

```bash
/council validate recent
/council --deep recent
```

### /swarm

Parallel agent spawning for concurrent task execution.

```bash
/swarm <epic-id>
```

### /codex-team

Spawn parallel Codex execution agents.

```bash
/codex-team <epic-id>
```

---

## Additional Utility Skills

### /handoff

Session handoff — preserve context for continuation.

```bash
/handoff
```

### /release

Pre-flight checks, changelog generation, version bumps, and tagging.

```bash
/release
```

### /status

Single-screen dashboard of project state.

```bash
/status
```

### /quickstart

Interactive onboarding — mini RPI cycle for new users.

```bash

```

### /trace

Trace design decisions through knowledge artifacts.

```

### /knowledge-activation

Operationalize a mature `.agents` corpus into reusable belief, playbook, briefing, and gap surfaces.

```bash
/knowledge-activation
ao knowledge activate --goal "productize knowledge activation"
ao knowledge gaps
```

### /recover

Post-compaction context recovery. Detects in-progress RPI and evolve sessions, loads knowledge, shows recent work and pending tasks.

```bash
/recover                     # Recover context after compaction
```

### /evolve

Autonomous fitness-scored improvement loop. Measures GOALS.yaml, fixes the worst gap, compounds via knowledge flywheel.

```bash
/evolve                      # Run until stopped or the full producer ladder is exhausted
/evolve --max-cycles=5       # Cap at 5 cycles
/evolve --dry-run            # Measure only, don't execute
```

### /product

Interactive PRODUCT.md generation. Interviews about mission, personas, value props, and competitive landscape.

```bash
/product
```

**Output:** `PRODUCT.md` in repo root

### /heal-skill

Detect and auto-fix skill hygiene issues (missing frontmatter, unlinked references, dead references).

```bash
/heal-skill --check                     # Report issues
/heal-skill --fix                       # Auto-fix what's safe
/heal-skill --check skills/council      # Check specific skill
```

### /converter

Convert skills to other platforms (Codex, Cursor).

```bash
/converter skills/council codex          # Single skill to Codex format
/converter --all cursor                  # All skills to Cursor .mdc format
```

**Targets:** codex (SKILL.md + prompt.md), cursor (.mdc + optional mcp.json), test (raw bundle)

### /openai-docs

```bash
/openai-docs "responses api tools"
```

### /oss-docs

Scaffold and audit open-source documentation packs (README, CONTRIBUTING, changelog, AGENTS).

```bash
/oss-docs
```

### /pr-research

Research upstream contribution conventions before implementing an external PR.

```bash
/pr-research https://github.com/org/repo
```
