## [Unreleased]

## [2.36.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- **Dream operator mode** — `ao overnight start|run|report|setup` adds a private overnight lane with shared `dream.*` config, keep-awake defaults, scheduler/bootstrap guidance, council-ready runner packets, and DreamScape-style morning summaries
- **Nightly live retrieval proof** — the dream-cycle now runs `ao retrieval-bench --live --json`, emits retrieval proof in nightly summaries, and keeps a visible artifact trail for flywheel health
- **Pattern-to-skill drafts** — repeated patterns can now generate review-only skill drafts under `.agents/skill-drafts/` during flywheel close-loop
- **Fresh-repo onboarding welcome** — new session-start routing helps first-time repos enter discovery, implementation, or validation without needing the full RPI lane first
- **Docs-site and contribution proof surfaces** — GitHub Pages navigation, comparison pages, behavioral-discipline guidance, strategic-doc validation patterns, and a first-skill guide expand the public proof surface

### Changed

- **Operational-layer framing** — README, onboarding, docs, comparisons, and linked surfaces now consistently explain AgentOps as bookkeeping, validation, primitives, and flows for coding agents
- **Dream runtime positioning** — the public GitHub nightly is now documented as a proof harness, while `ao overnight` is documented as the private local compounding engine
- **Codex default path** — native hooks, install copy, runtime smoke coverage, and checked-in Codex artifacts are aligned around the native-plugin path on supported Codex versions
- **Validation guidance** — behavioral-discipline and strategic-doc review are now first-class references alongside code review and runtime validation

### Fixed

- **Release and CI drift** — resolved docs-site Liquid/frontmatter issues, headless runtime smoke portability problems, pre-push shim test drift, and compile-skill headless command drift caught during release prep
- **Codex install and artifact drift** — fixed stale slash-command references, refreshed checked-in artifact metadata, added a Codex compile wrapper, and corrected plugin/marketplace mismatches exercised by smoke coverage
- **Runtime proof stability** — promoted Codex runtime smoke into the blocking smoke path and fixed related shellcheck and install-surface rough edges

### Removed

- **DevOps-rooted tagline** — public framing no longer leads with the old DevOps-layer tagline; the Three Ways lineage remains supporting doctrine instead of the category label

## [2.35.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- **Codex native hooks** — AgentOps hooks now install natively into Codex CLI v0.115.0+ via `~/.codex/hooks.json`; 8 hooks wired (session-start, inject, flywheel-close, prompt-nudge, quality-signals, go-test-precommit, commit-review, ratchet-advance); installer enables `codex_hooks` feature and upgrades from hookless fallback to native hook runtime
- **Knowledge compiler skill** — renamed athena → `/compile` with Karpathy-style incremental compilation, pluggable LLM backend (`AGENTOPS_COMPILE_RUNTIME=ollama|claude`), interlinked markdown wiki output at `.agents/compiled/`
- **App struct dependency injection** — `App` struct carries `ExecCommand`, `LookPath`, `RandReader`, `Stdout`, `Stderr` seams; gc bridge, events, executor, context relevance, tracker health, and stream modules accept injected dependencies instead of mutable package-level vars
- **Test shuffle in CI** — `-shuffle=on` added to `validate.yml` and `Makefile` test targets, exposing and fixing 6 ordering-dependent tests (cobra flag leaks, maturity var leaks, env var leaks)

### Changed

- **CLI internal extraction (waves 5-13)** — business logic extracted from `cmd/ao` monolith into 15 `internal/` domain packages (`rpi`, `search`, `context`, `quality`, `goals`, `lifecycle`, `bridge`, `forge`, `mine`, `plans`, `knowledge`, `storage`, `pool`, `taxonomy`, `worker`) using Options struct pattern for dependency injection
- **Goals test migration** — 7 goals test files moved from `cmd/ao` to `internal/goals` as external test package (`goals_test`) with `t.Parallel()` and direct `goals.Run*()` calls replacing cobra command wiring
- **Test isolation** — `resetCommandState` now saves/restores 10 maturity globals; `resetFlagChangesRecursive` resets flag values to defaults; RPILoop and toolchain tests clear `AGENTOPS_RPI_RUNTIME*` env vars via `t.Setenv`

### Fixed

- **Defrag test flag leak** — `TestDefragOutputDirFlag` used `cmd.Flags().Lookup("output")` which matched the root persistent `--output` flag; changed to `cmd.LocalFlags().Lookup("output")`
- **Goroutine leak false positive** — `TestRunGoals_GoroutineLeak` used `goleak.VerifyNone` which caught goroutines from parallel tests; switched to `goleak.IgnoreCurrent()` to only detect leaks within the test itself
- **Secret scan false positives** — excluded `.gc/` directory and `Getenv`/`os.Environ` patterns from secret pattern scan
- **Codex skill validation** — added `output_contract` as valid schema key, `cross-vendor`/`knowledge` as valid tiers, fixed `$/` prefix in codex forge/post-mortem/scenario skills
- **Scenario CLI snippets** — replaced non-existent `--source`/`--scope` flags with valid `--status` variants

### Removed

- **Coverage percentage CI gates** — removed `coverage-ratchet` job, `check-cmdao-coverage-floor.sh`, `.coverage-baseline.json`, and associated BATS tests; percentage gates blocked CI during architectural refactors without catching bugs
- **`fire.go`** — FIRE loop (find-ignite-reap-escalate) superseded by gc sling + bead dispatch; `formatAge` helper moved to `inject_predecessor.go`
- **`rpi_workers.go`** — per-worker health display superseded by gc agent health patrol; `ao rpi workers` subcommand removed from CLI and docs

## [2.34.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- **Stage 4 Behavioral Validation** — new validation tier between council/vibe and production:
  - Holdout scenarios stored in `.agents/holdout/` with PreToolUse isolation hook preventing implementing agents from seeing evaluation criteria
  - Satisfaction scoring (0.0-1.0 probabilistic) in verdict schema v4, replacing boolean-only PASS/FAIL
  - Agent-built behavioral specs generated during `/implement` Step 5c
  - `/scenario` skill for authoring and managing holdout scenarios
  - `ao scenario init|list|validate` CLI commands (4 subcommands, 11 tests)
  - STEP 1.8 in `/validation` pipeline evaluating holdout scenarios + agent specs
  - `schemas/scenario.v1.schema.json` defining the holdout scenario format
- **Flywheel gate command** — `ao flywheel gate` checks readiness for retrieval-expansion work (research closure, rho threshold, holdout precision@K)
- **Citation confidence scoring** — `citationEventIsHighConfidence` with bucketed confidence (0/0.5/0.7/0.9) gates MemRL rewards on match quality
- **Retrieval bench refactor** — train/holdout splits, section-aware scoring (`scoreBenchSections`), manifest-based benchmark cases
- **Proof-backed next-work visibility** — `classifyNextWorkCompletionProof` unifies completed-run, execution-packet, and evidence-only-closure proof types; context explain and stigmergic packet now report proof-backed suppressions
- **Three-gap contract proof gates** — lifecycle gap mapping gates added to GOALS.md
- **Cross-vendor execution** — `--mixed` flag for Claude + Codex council judges
- **Gas City bridge** — gc as default executor for RPI phase execution with L1-L3 tests
- **149 L2 integration tests** — AI-native test shape ("L2 first, L1 always") validated at scale; coverage floor raised 78.8% → 81.0%
- **Test coverage hardening** — GPG commit-signing fixes, root-skip guards for containerized CI, 350+ lines of vibecheck detector/metrics tests, maturity.go empty-content bugfix

### Changed

- **Codex parity hook** — `codex-parity-warn.sh` now supports opt-in blocking mode via `AGENTOPS_CODEX_PARITY_BLOCK=1` (exit 2 instead of advisory)
- **12-factor doctrine** — compressed from 474 to 114 lines, reframed as supporting lens rather than product definition
- **Skill count** — 65 → 66 (added `/scenario`)
- **Research skill** — now persists reusable findings to `.agents/findings/registry.jsonl` with finding-compiler refresh
- **Closure integrity audit** — accepts durable closure packets without scoped-file sections as valid evidence
- **Proof-backed legacy entries** — `shouldSkipLegacyFailedEntry` uses `CompletionEvidence` field (proof-only, no heuristic fallback)
- **`readQueueEntries`** — returns all non-consumed entries; proof filtering is downstream via `shouldSkipLegacyFailedEntry`

### Fixed

- **6 CI failure categories** resolved in one commit (f1b83b25)
- **Cobra test registration** — `scenario` and `flywheel gate` added to expectedCmds
- **Citation feedback test** — assertion corrected for recorded confidence preference (0.5 not 0.7)
- **RPI hardening** — UAT version pre-flight, goals history filter, proof-backed suppression, fail-closed gates, cross-epic handoff contamination, bare ag- prefix guard
- **Branch consolidation** — 10 stale Codex branches analyzed, cherry-picked (9 commits, ~3,500 lines), and deleted; 25 orphaned worktrees pruned
- **git rerere enabled** — conflict resolution memory for future merges

  compiler and prevention-ratchet validation path so saved findings feed back
  into earlier planning and task validation more reliably
- **Runtime contract parity** — Localized shared Claude runtime reference
  packs into the source skills and regenerated Codex artifacts so source and
  generated bundles stay aligned

### Fixed

  coherence, and hook-fixture isolation so the local release gate matches the
  shipped tree again

## [2.22.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Finding registry** — Council findings are saved to a persistent registry
  and automatically fed back into planning and validation, so the same class

- Release-prep validation flows for runtime smoke, Codex artifact sync, and release note generation

### Fixed
- Next-work queue mutation races by making claim/update handling concurrency-safe and per-item
- Codex prompt parity drift by syncing generated prompts and tightening override coverage gates
- Worktree Git resolution and vibe-check runtime environment handling
- Push/pre-push validation regressions and nested pre-push wrappers
- Streamed phase timeout cancellation so phased runtime tests and release gating terminate promptly

## [2.20.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- Codex install workflow now uses `~/.agents/skills` as the single raw skill home and stops recreating an AgentOps mirror in `~/.codex/skills`
- Native Codex plugin refresh now archives overlapping legacy `~/.codex/skills` AgentOps folders instead of repopulating them
- Codex install docs now consistently describe the `~/.agents/skills` workflow and the need for a fresh Codex session after install
- Codex skill conversion now preserves multiline YAML `description` fields correctly, fixing malformed generated metadata for skills such as Compile
- `ao doctor` now treats plugin-cache plus `~/.agents/skills` as the supported Codex layout and reports manifest drift with accurate wording

## [2.20.0] - 2026-03-05

## [2.19.2] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- CHANGELOG retrospectively updated to document all v2.19.1 post-tag commits (skills namespace fixes were shipped but not recorded)

## [2.19.1] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- Quickstart skill rewritten from 275 lines to 68 lines — removes 90-line ASCII diagram and 50-line intent router that caused 3+ minute runtime; now outputs ~8 lines and completes in under 30 seconds
- `truncateText` edge case: maxLen 1–3 now returns `"..."[:maxLen]` instead of the original string unchanged
- Dead anti-pattern promotion functions removed from `ao maturity` (`promoteAntiPatternsCmd`, `filterTransitionsByNewMaturity`, `displayAntiPatternCandidates`, ~99 LOC)
- Windows file-lock and signal support — replace no-op `filelock_windows.go` with real `LockFileEx`/`UnlockFileEx` via kernel32.dll; extract `syscall.Flock` and `syscall.Kill` into platform-specific helpers so the binary compiles on Windows without POSIX-only syscalls
- `heal.sh` Check 7 false positive — script reference integrity check now strips URLs before pattern matching, preventing remote `https://…/scripts/foo.sh` references from being validated as local files
- Security gate `BLOCKED_HIGH` — three persistent findings resolved: gosec G118 false positive (context cancel func returned to caller), golangci-lint nolint syntax (space in `// nolint:` directive), radon double-counting `reverse_engineer_rpi.py` from `skills-codex/` copy
- 71 stale `ao know *` and `ao quality *` namespace references replaced across 17 `skills-codex/` SKILL.md files — agents running rpi/evolve/crank were invoking non-existent commands from the pre-flatten CLI namespace
- Three HIGH-severity stale command references fixed across `skills/` and `skills-codex/`: `ao flywheel status` → `ao metrics flywheel status`, `ao settings notebook update` → `ao notebook update`, `ao start seed/init` → `ao seed`/`ao init`

### Added
- Spec-consistency gate (`scripts/spec-consistency-gate.sh`) validates contract files before crank spawns workers

- Comprehensive cmd/ao test coverage push — 500+ tests across 5 waves reaching 79.2% statement coverage (13 untestable functions excluded)

### Changed
- SessionStart hook default mode changed from full inject to `lean` (extract + lean inject, shrinks when MEMORY.md is fresh)
- `ao flywheel close-loop` now applies ALL maturity transitions (not just anti-pattern)
- `ao hooks` generated config uses script-based commands instead of inline ao invocations
- `ao rpi` prefers epic-type issues before falling back to any open issue

### Fixed
