# Skill API Reference

> Definitive reference for AgentOps SKILL.md frontmatter fields. Schema: `schemas/skill-frontmatter.v1.schema.json`.

## Frontmatter Format

Every skill has a YAML frontmatter block between `---` delimiters at the top of `SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: 'What this skill does. Triggers: "keyword1", "keyword2".'
skill_api_version: 1
context:
  window: fork
  intent:
    mode: task
  sections:
    exclude: [HISTORY]
  intel_scope: topic
metadata:
  tier: execution
---
```

## Required Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Skill identifier (must match directory name) |
| `description` | string | What the skill does, including trigger phrases |
| `skill_api_version` | integer | Always `1` (const) |

## Optional Fields

### `context`

Controls what knowledge `ao lookup --for=<skill>` provides. Two forms:

**String form** (backward compat):
```yaml
context: fork
```

**Object form** (recommended):
```yaml
context:
  window: isolated
  intent:
    mode: task
  sections:
    exclude: [HISTORY]
  intel_scope: full
```

#### `context.window`

How the skill's execution context relates to the parent session.

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `isolated` | Fresh context, no parent inheritance. For judgment and mechanical skills. |
| `fork` | Copy parent context as starting point. For skills that need to know what you're working on. |
| `inherit` | Use full parent context as-is. For session utilities (status, handoff, recover). |

**v1 status:** Parsed and stored. Not enforced at runtime (Phase 2).

#### `context.sections`

Filter which knowledge sections are injected.

```yaml
sections:
  include: [INTEL, TASK]     # Allowlist — only these sections
  exclude: [HISTORY]         # Blocklist — everything except these
```

If both `include` and `exclude` are set, `include` takes precedence.

Valid section names:

| Section | Knowledge Fields |
|---------|-----------------|
| `HISTORY` | Past session summaries |
| `INTEL` | Learnings and patterns from the knowledge flywheel |
| `TASK` | Current bead ID and predecessor context |

**v1 status:** Actively enforced at runtime. `ao lookup --for=<skill>` zeroes excluded/non-included sections.

#### `context.intent.mode`

Declares what the skill is doing.

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `task` | Executing work (implement, plan, validate) |
| `questions` | Exploring or researching |
| `none` | Operational utility (status, push, update) |

**v1 status:** Parsed and stored. Not enforced at runtime (Phase 2 — orchestrators will use this to adapt behavior).

#### `context.intel_scope`

How much of the knowledge flywheel to inject.

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `full` | All learnings and patterns |
| `topic` | Only learnings matching the current query/task |
| `none` | No learnings or patterns injected |

**v1 status:** `none` is actively enforced (zeroes learnings + patterns). `topic` and `full` are declaration-only (Phase 2).

### `allowed-tools`

Restricts which tools the skill can auto-approve.

```yaml
# Array form
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Grep
  - Glob
  - Bash

# String form (comma-separated)
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
```

### `model`

Preferred model for skill execution.

```yaml
model: haiku    # Use cheaper/faster model for lightweight skills
```

Currently used by `flywheel` and `status`. Declaration-only — no CLI enforcement.

### `user-invocable`

Whether the skill appears in the slash-command list.

```yaml
user-invocable: true   # Shows as /skill-name
user-invocable: false  # Hidden from user, used by other skills
```

### `metadata`

Skill classification and dependency information.

```yaml
metadata:
  tier: execution           # See tier values below
  dependencies: [standards] # Skills loaded as context
  internal: false           # If true, not published externally
  version: "1.0.0"
  author: "Gas Town"
  triggers: ["keyword"]     # Additional trigger phrases
  replaces: old-skill-name  # Supersedes another skill
```
