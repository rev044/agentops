# Newcomer Guide: Understanding the AgentOps Repo

If you're new to this repository, this guide gives you a practical mental model, a map of where things live, and a fast path to becoming productive.

## What this repo is

AgentOps is a **skills + hooks + CLI** system that helps coding agents compound knowledge across sessions instead of restarting from zero each time.

At a high level:

1. Run workflows with skills (`/research`, `/plan`, `/crank`, `/vibe`, `/post-mortem`)
2. Persist knowledge in `.agents/`
3. Inject the best prior learnings into the next session
4. Enforce quality through hooks and CI gates

## Repo structure (what matters most)

Think in five layers:

1. **Product/docs layer** — `docs/` + root docs (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, etc.)
2. **Skills layer** — `skills/` and `skills-codex/` (`SKILL.md` contracts + per-skill scripts/references)
3. **Hooks layer** — `hooks/` with active runtime manifest in `hooks/hooks.json`
4. **CLI layer** — `cli/` (`cli/cmd/ao/`, `cli/internal/`, generated `cli/docs/COMMANDS.md`)
5. **Validation layer** — `scripts/`, `tests/`, and `.github/workflows/validate.yml`

## Source-of-truth precedence

When docs disagree, follow this order:

1. Executable code + generated artifacts (`cli/**`, `hooks/**`, `scripts/**`, `cli/docs/COMMANDS.md`)
2. Skill contracts/manifests (`skills/**/SKILL.md`, `hooks/hooks.json`, `schemas/**`)
3. Explanatory docs (`docs/**`, `README.md`)


## Key concepts to learn first

### 1) Context quality is the core design principle

The architecture assumes output quality depends on input context quality. Most patterns in this repo are about context scoping, isolation, and compounding.

### 2) Skills are composable workflows

Use the router in [Skills Reference](SKILLS.md) to choose the right entry point:

- Start with uncertainty: `/research`
- Break work into issues: `/plan`
- Implement one issue: `/implement`
- Run multi-issue waves: `/crank`
- Run end-to-end lifecycle: `/rpi`

### 3) Hooks are part of runtime behavior

The active hook manifest in `hooks/hooks.json` is authoritative for what runs at session boundaries.

### 4) CLI docs are generated, not hand-maintained

`cli/docs/COMMANDS.md` is generated. If command behavior changes, regenerate docs and keep parity checks passing.

### 5) CI checks many non-code contracts

CI validates not just builds/tests but also docs parity, hook safety, skill integrity/schema, security scans, and contract compatibility.

## Suggested learning path

### Day 1 reading order

1. `README.md`
2. `docs/INDEX.md`
3. `docs/how-it-works.md`
4. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
5. `docs/SKILLS.md`

### Then pick one domain

- **CLI behavior:** `cli/cmd/ao/`, `cli/internal/`, `cli/docs/COMMANDS.md`
- **Skill behavior:** `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- **Hook/gate behavior:** `hooks/hooks.json` + `hooks/*.sh`
- **Validation/release/security:** `scripts/*.sh` + `tests/` + `.github/workflows/validate.yml`

### Recommended first contributions

1. **Docs-only fix** (safe): update wording or cross-links and run docs validation scripts.
2. **Hook/docs parity fix** (medium): update docs to match runtime hook manifest and validate parity.
3. **Small CLI command improvement** (advanced beginner): update command behavior, regenerate CLI docs, and run CLI checks.

## Practical tips

- Trust runtime files over narrative docs when there is a mismatch.
- Keep changes small and verify with local gates before pushing.
- Treat `.agents/` and hooks as first-class parts of the system behavior.
- If you touch command surfaces or hook contracts, expect related parity checks to fail until updated.
