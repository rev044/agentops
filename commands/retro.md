# /retro - Session Retrospective

**Purpose:** Capture learnings, audit tool usage, identify improvements after completing work

**When to use:**
- After completing significant work (implementation, debugging, deployment)
- End of session before context is lost
- After hitting failures or blockers
- Periodic team retrospectives

**Token budget:** 15-25k tokens (8-12% of context)

**Output:** Retrospective bundle with actionable improvements

**Output location:** `.agents/learnings/retros/[date]-[topic].md`

**Integration:** After retro, run `/learn` to extract patterns to `.agents/learnings/`

---

## The Retrospective Philosophy

**"Every session is a learning opportunity."**

Retrospectives serve three purposes:
1. **Capture learnings** before context is lost
2. **Audit tool usage** to improve our .claude/ ecosystem
3. **Identify patterns** (both failure and success) for future work

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# After completing work
/retro

# With specific focus
/retro --focus "infrastructure deployment"

# For failure analysis
/retro --failure "what went wrong"
```

---

## Retrospective Framework

### Section 1: Work Summary

**What was accomplished:**
- [ ] Tasks completed
- [ ] Deliverables produced
- [ ] Time invested

**What was blocked:**
- [ ] Blockers encountered
- [ ] Time lost to blockers
- [ ] Root causes identified

### Section 2: Vibe-Coding Failure Pattern Analysis

**For each of the 12 patterns, assess if it was hit:**

|----------|-------|----------|--------|
| [workflow-name] | Y/N | 1-5 | |

**Cline workflows that SHOULD EXIST:**

|----------|------------------|------------|
| | | |

**Cline/Claude coordination issues:**

| Issue | Impact | Resolution |
|-------|--------|------------|
| | | |

---

## Command Options

```bash
# Full retrospective
/retro

# Focus on specific area
/retro --focus "deployment"

# Failure-focused
/retro --failure "what went wrong"

# Quick retro (summary only)
/retro --quick

# Team retro (multiple sessions)
/retro --team --since "2025-11-01"
```

---

## Session Naming (Optional)

Name the session for future reference:

```bash
/rename "retro-{topic}-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
```

**Naming Convention:**
- `retro-oauth-2026-01-19` - For feature retros
- `retro-debug-mem-leak-2026-01-19` - For debugging retros
- `retro-epic-ap-123-2026-01-19` - For epic completion retros

**Future Access:**
- `/resume` - Browse recent sessions from same repo
- `--continue` - Continue most recent session

**When to Name:**
- Significant debugging sessions
- Epic completions
- Discovery of reusable patterns

---

## Integration with Other Commands

**After /retro:**

1. **Name the session:** `/rename retro-[topic]-[date]` (for future `/resume`)
2. **Extract learnings:** `/learn [topic]`
3. **Save retrospective:** `/bundle-save retro-[topic]-[date]`
4. **Create improvements:** Implement identified skills/workflows/agents

**Retro should trigger:**
- Pattern extraction via `/learn`
- Skill/workflow/agent creation if gaps identified
- Documentation updates if processes need clarification

---

## Best Practices

### Do
- Run retro while context is fresh
- Be honest about failure patterns hit
- Identify specific .claude/ improvements
- Follow up on action items

### Don't
- Skip retro after failures (that's when it's most valuable)
- Blame without identifying systemic improvements
- Create action items without owners
- Ignore recurring patterns

---

**Ready?** Run `/retro` after completing significant work.
