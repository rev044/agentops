# Plan Skill

> **Quick Ref:** Decompose goal into trackable issues with waves. Output: `.agents/plans/*.md` + bd issues.

**YOU MUST EXECUTE THIS WORKFLOW. Do not just describe it.**

**CLI dependencies:** bd (issue creation). If bd is unavailable, write the plan to `.agents/plans/` as markdown with issue descriptions, and use TaskList for tracking instead. The plan document is always created regardless of bd availability.

## Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--auto` | off | Skip human approval gate. Used by `/rpi --auto` for fully autonomous lifecycle. |

## Execution Steps

Given `/plan <goal> [--auto]`:

### Step 1: Setup
```bash
mkdir -p .agents/plans
```

### Step 2: Check for Prior Research

Look for existing research on this topic:
```bash
ls -la .agents/research/ 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

Use Grep to search `.agents/` for related content. If research exists, read it with the Read tool to understand the context before planning.

**Search knowledge flywheel for prior planning patterns:**
```bash
if command -v ao &>/dev/null; then
    ao search "<topic> plan decomposition patterns" 2>/dev/null | head -10
fi
```
If ao returns relevant learnings or patterns, incorporate them into the plan. Skip silently if ao is unavailable or returns no results.

### Step 2.1: Load Compiled Prevention First (Mandatory)

Before decomposition, load compiled planning rules from `.agents/planning-rules/*.md` when they exist. This is the primary prevention surface for `/plan` in the compiler-enabled flow.

Use the tracked contracts in `docs/contracts/finding-compiler.md` and `docs/contracts/finding-registry.md`:

- prefer compiled planning rules first
- match by finding ID, `applicable_when` overlap, language overlap, and literal goal-text overlap
- when file inventory is known, rank by changed-file overlap before falling back to weaker textual matches
- cap the injected set at top 5 findings / rule files
- if compiled planning rules are missing, incomplete, or fewer than the matched finding set, fall back to `.agents/findings/registry.jsonl`
- fail open:
  - missing compiled directory or registry -> skip silently
  - empty compiled directory or registry -> skip silently
  - malformed line -> warn and ignore that line
  - unreadable file -> warn once and continue without findings

Use the selected planning rules / active findings as hard planning context before issue decomposition. Record the applied finding IDs and how they changed the plan. These become required context for the written plan, not optional side notes.

**Ranked packet contract:** Treat compiled planning rules, active findings, and matching high-severity `next-work.jsonl` items as one ranked packet, not three unrelated lookups. The packet must prefer the strongest overlap in this order:
1. literal goal-text overlap
2. `applicable_when` / issue-type overlap
3. language overlap
4. changed-file overlap (once the file table exists)
5. backlog severity / repo affinity for next-work items

### Step 2.2: Read and Validate Research Content

If research files exist, read the most recent one and verify it contains substantive findings before proceeding:

```bash
LATEST_RESEARCH=$(ls -t .agents/research/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [ -n "$LATEST_RESEARCH" ]; then
    # Verify research has substantive content (not just frontmatter)
    if grep -qE '^## (Key Findings|Architecture|Executive Summary|Recommendations|Part [0-9])' "$LATEST_RESEARCH"; then
        echo "Research validated: $LATEST_RESEARCH"
    else
        echo "WARNING: Research file exists but lacks standard sections (Key Findings, Architecture, Executive Summary, or Recommendations)."
        echo "Consider running /research first for a thorough exploration."
    fi
fi
```

**Read the validated research file** with the Read tool before proceeding to Step 3. Do not plan based solely on file existence — understanding the research content is essential for accurate decomposition.

### Step 3: Explore the Codebase (if needed)

**USE THE TASK TOOL** to dispatch an Explore agent. The explore prompt MUST request symbol-level detail:

```
Tool: Task
Parameters:
  subagent_type: "Explore"
  description: "Understand codebase for: <goal>"
  prompt: |
    Explore the codebase to understand what's needed for: <goal>

    1. Find relevant files and modules
    2. Understand current architecture
    3. Identify what needs to change

    For EACH file that needs modification, return:
    - Exact function/method signatures that need changes
    - Struct/type definitions that need new fields
    - Key functions to reuse (with file:line references)
    - Existing test file locations and naming conventions (e.g., TestFoo_Bar)
    - Import paths and package relationships

    Return: file inventory, per-file symbol details, reuse points with line numbers, test patterns
```

#### Pre-Planning Baseline Audit (Mandatory)

**Before decomposing into issues**, run a quantitative baseline audit to ground the plan in verified numbers. This is mandatory for ALL plans — not just cleanup/refactor. Any plan that makes quantitative claims (counts, sizes, coverage) must verify them mechanically.

Run grep/wc/ls commands to count the current state of what you're changing:

- **Files to change:** count with `ls`/`find`/`wc -l`
- **Sections to add/remove:** count with `grep -l`/`grep -L`
- **Code to modify:** count LOC, packages, import references
- **Coverage gaps:** count missing items with `grep -L` or `find`

**Record the verification commands alongside their results.** These become pre-mortem evidence and acceptance criteria.

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| "14 missing refs/" | "14 missing refs/ (verified: `ls -d skills/*/references/ \| wc -l` = 20 of 34)" |
| "clean up dead code" | "Delete 3,003 LOC across 3 packages (verified: `find src/old -name '*.go' \| xargs wc -l`)" |
| "update stale docs" | "Rewrite 4 specs (verified: `ls docs/specs/*.md \| wc -l` = 4)" |
| "add missing sections" | "Add Examples to 27 skills (verified: `grep -L '## Examples' skills/*/SKILL.md \| wc -l` = 27)" |

- **Test fixtures affected:** count test fixtures upstream of any filter/gate/hook being added or modified with `grep -rn 'func Test' <test-dir>/ | wc -l`. Changing a gate without updating its test fixtures causes false-green CI.

Ground truth with numbers prevents scope creep and makes completion verifiable. In ol-571, the audit found 5,752 LOC to remove — without it, the plan would have been vague. In ag-dnu, wrong counts (11 vs 14, 0 vs 7) caused a pre-mortem FAIL that a simple grep audit would have prevented.

### Step 3.5: Generate Implementation Detail (Mandatory)

**After exploring the codebase**, generate symbol-level implementation detail for EVERY file in the plan. This is what separates actionable specs from vague descriptions. A worker reading the plan should know exactly what to write without rediscovering function names, parameters, or code locations.

#### File Inventory Table

Start with a `## Files to Modify` table listing EVERY file the plan touches:

```markdown
## Files to Modify

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/auth/middleware.go` | Add rate limit check to `AuthMiddleware` |
| `src/config/config.go` | Add `RateLimit` section to `Config` struct |
| `src/auth/middleware_test.go` | **NEW** — rate limit middleware tests |
```

Mark new files with `**NEW**`. This table gives the implementer the full blast radius in 30 seconds.

#### Per-Section Implementation Specs

For each logical change group, provide symbol-level detail:

1. **Exact function signatures** — name the function, its parameters, and what changes:
   - "Add `worktreePath string` parameter to `classifyRunStatus`"
   - "Create new `RPIConfig` struct with `WorktreeMode string` field"

2. **Key functions to reuse** — with `file:line` references from the explore step:
   - "Reuse `readRunHeartbeat()` at `rpi_phased.go:1963`"
   - "Call existing `parsePhasedState()` at `rpi_phased.go:1924`"

3. **Inline code blocks** — for non-obvious constructs (struct definitions, CLI flags, config snippets). Verify all inline snippets compile with `go build ./...` before including them in issue descriptions — workers copy them verbatim:
   ```go
   type RPIConfig struct {
       WorktreeMode string `yaml:"worktree_mode" json:"worktree_mode"`
   }
   ```

4. **New struct fields with tags** — exact field names and JSON/YAML tags

5. **CLI flag definitions** — exact flag names, types, defaults, and help text

#### Named Test Functions

For each test file, list specific test functions with one-line descriptions:

```markdown
**`src/auth/middleware_test.go`** — add:
- `TestRateLimitMiddleware_UnderLimit`: Request within limit returns 200
- `TestRateLimitMiddleware_OverLimit`: Request exceeding limit returns 429
- `TestRateLimitMiddleware_ResetAfterWindow`: Counter resets after time window
```

#### Test Level Classification

For each test in the plan, classify its pyramid level per the test pyramid standard (`test-pyramid.md` in the standards skill):

| Test | Level | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| `TestRateLimitMiddleware_UnderLimit` | L1 (Unit) | Single function behavior in isolation |
| `TestRateLimitMiddleware_Integration` | L2 (Integration) | Middleware + config store interaction |
| `TestRateLimitMiddleware_E2E` | L3 (Component) | Full request pipeline with mocked Redis |

Include `test_levels` metadata in each issue's validation block:
```json
{
  "test_levels": {
    "required": ["L0", "L1"],
    "recommended": ["L2"],
    "rationale": "Reason for level selection"
  }
}
```

Agents own L0–L3 autonomously. L4+ requires human-defined scenarios — flag these as "human gate" items in the plan.

#### Verification Procedures

Add a `## Verification` section with runnable bash sequences that reproduce the scenario and confirm the fix:

```markdown
## Verification

1. **Unit tests**: `go test ./src/auth/ -run "TestRateLimit" -v`
2. **Build check**: `go build ./...`
3. **Manual simulation**:
   ```bash
   # Start server
   go run ./cmd/server/ &
   # Hit endpoint 11 times (limit is 10)
   for i in $(seq 1 11); do curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" localhost:8080/api; done
   # Last request should return 429
   ```
```

**Why this matters:** The golden plan pattern (file tables + symbol-level specs + verification procedures) enabled single-pass implementation of an 8-file, 5-area change with zero ambiguity. Category-level specs ("modify classifyRunStatus") force implementers to rediscover symbols, causing divergence and rework.

#### Data Transformation Mapping Tables (Mandatory for Filtering)

When a plan declares any struct-level filtering, exclusion, or allowlist logic:
- Create an explicit mapping table showing **source field → output transformation**
- Format: source name → fields affected → transformation (zeroed, renamed, computed)

Example from context orchestration (na-0v2):

| Section Name | Fields Zeroed |
|---|---|
| `HISTORY` | `Sessions` |
| `INTEL` | `Learnings`, `Patterns` |
| `TASK` | `BeadID`, `Predecessor` |

**Why:** Without explicit mapping tables, workers misinterpret data transformations. In na-0v2, section→field mapping ambiguity was caught only in pre-mortem. An explicit table prevents the concern entirely.

### Step 4: Decompose into Issues

Analyze the goal and break it into discrete, implementable issues. For each issue define:
- **Title**: Clear action verb (e.g., "Add authentication middleware")
- **Description**: What needs to be done
- **Dependencies**: Which issues must complete first (if any)
- **Acceptance criteria**: How to verify it's done
- **Test levels**: Which pyramid levels (L0–L3) this issue's tests cover (see the test pyramid standard (`test-pyramid.md` in the standards skill))

#### Design Briefs for Rewrites

For any issue that says "rewrite", "redesign", or "create from scratch":
Include a **design brief** (3+ sentences) covering:
1. **Purpose** — what does this component do in the new architecture?
2. **Key artifacts** — what files/interfaces define success?
3. **Workflows** — what sequences must work?

Without a design brief, workers invent design decisions. In ol-571, a spec rewrite issue without a design brief produced output that diverged from the intended architecture.

#### Issue Granularity

- **1-2 independent files** → 1 issue
- **3+ independent files with no code deps** → split into sub-issues (one per file)
  - Example: "Rewrite 4 specs" → 4 sub-issues (4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4)
  - Enables N parallel workers instead of 1 serial worker
- **Shared files between issues** → serialize or assign to same worker

#### Operationalization Heuristics

Each issue must be immediately executable by a swarm worker without further research:

- **File ownership (`metadata.files`):** List every file the issue touches. Workers use this for conflict detection.
- **Validation commands (`metadata.validation`):** Include runnable checks (e.g., `go test ./...`, `bash -n script.sh`). Workers run these before reporting done.
- **Homogeneous wave grouping:** Group issues by work type (all Go, all docs, all shell) within the same wave. Mixed-type waves cause toolchain context-switching and increase conflict risk.
- **Same-file serialization:** If two issues touch the same file, flag them for serialization (different waves) or merge into one issue. Never assign same-file issues to parallel workers.

#### Conformance Checks

For each issue's acceptance criteria, derive at least one **mechanically verifiable** conformance check using validation-contract.md types. These checks bridge the gap between spec intent and implementation verification.

| Acceptance Criteria | Conformance Check |
|-----|------|
| "File X exists" | `files_exist: ["X"]` |
| "Function Y is implemented" | `content_check: {file: "src/foo.go", pattern: "func Y"}` |
| "Tests pass" | `tests: "go test ./..."` |
| "Endpoint returns 200" | `command: "curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' localhost:8080/api \| grep 200"` |
| "Config has setting Z" | `content_check: {file: "config.yaml", pattern: "setting_z:"}` |

**Rules:**
- Every issue MUST have at least one conformance check
- Checks MUST use validation-contract.md types: `files_exist`, `content_check`, `command`, `tests`, `lint`
- Prefer `content_check` and `files_exist` (fast, deterministic) over `command` (slower, environment-dependent)
- If acceptance criteria cannot be mechanically verified, flag it as underspecified
- When adding entries to config files enumerated by tests, search for hardcoded count assertions: `grep -rn 'len.*!=\|len.*==\|expected.*count' <test-dir>/`

#### Schema Strictness Pre-Flight (WARN)

When any issue's file list includes JSON schema files (`*.schema.json`, files in `schemas/`), check for `additionalProperties: false`:

```bash
for f in <issue-files matching *.schema.json or schemas/*.json>; do
  if grep -q '"additionalProperties":\s*false' "$f" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "WARN: $f has additionalProperties:false — new fields require schema update BEFORE consumer changes"
  fi
done
```

**If triggered:** Ensure schema-modifying issues are in an earlier wave than issues that reference the new fields. This prevents implementation failures where consumer SKILL.md files reference fields that the schema doesn't yet allow.

This is advisory (WARN, not FAIL). The wave decomposition in Step 5 must respect this ordering.

### Step 5: Compute Waves

Group issues by dependencies for parallel execution:
- **Wave 1**: Issues with no dependencies (can run in parallel)
- **Wave 2**: Issues depending only on Wave 1
- **Wave 3**: Issues depending on Wave 2
- Continue until all issues assigned

#### File-Level Dependency Matrix (Mandatory)

Before assigning issues to waves, build a file-conflict matrix. For EACH issue, list which files it modifies. If any file appears in 2+ same-wave issues, either:
- **Serialize** them (move one to a later wave), or
- **Merge** them into a single issue assigned to one worker.

```markdown
## File-Conflict Matrix

| File | Issues |
|------|--------|
| `src/auth.go` | Issue 1, Issue 3 | ← CONFLICT: serialize or merge
| `src/config.go` | Issue 2 |
| `src/auth_test.go` | Issue 1 |
```

**Why:** Issue-level dependency graphs miss shared-file conflicts. In context-orchestration-leverage, two tracks both modified `rpi_phased_handoff.go` and required an unplanned Wave 2a/2b split. A file-conflict matrix would have caught this during planning.

#### Cross-Wave Shared File Registry (Mandatory)

After computing waves, build a **cross-wave file registry** listing every file that appears in issues across different waves. These files are collision risks because later-wave worktrees are created from a base SHA that may not include earlier-wave changes.

```markdown
## Cross-Wave Shared Files

| File | Wave 1 Issues | Wave 2+ Issues | Mitigation |
|------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| `src/auth_test.go` | Issue 1 | Issue 5 | Wave 2 worktree must branch from post-Wave-1 SHA |
| `src/config.go` | Issue 2 | Issue 6 | Serial: Issue 6 blocked by Issue 2 |
```

**If any file appears in multiple waves:**
1. Ensure the later-wave issue explicitly declares a dependency on the earlier-wave issue that touches the same file (so `bd dep add` / `addBlockedBy` is set).
2. Flag the file in the plan's `## Cross-Wave Shared Files` section so `/crank` can enforce worktree base refresh between waves.
3. For test files shared across waves, prefer splitting test additions into the same wave as the code they test — avoid a separate "test coverage" issue that touches files already modified in an earlier wave.

**Why:** In na-vs9, Wave 2 agents started from pre-Wave-1 SHA. A Wave 2 test coverage issue overwrote Wave 1's `.md→.json` fix in `rpi_phased_test.go` because the worktree didn't include Wave 1's commit. The cross-wave registry makes these collisions visible during planning.

#### Validate Dependency Necessity

For EACH declared dependency, verify:
1. Does the blocked issue modify a file that the blocker also modifies? → **Keep**
2. Does the blocked issue read output produced by the blocker? → **Keep**
3. Is the dependency only logical ordering (e.g., "specs before roles")? → **Remove**

False dependencies reduce parallelism. Pre-mortem judges will also flag these. In ol-571, unnecessary serialization between independent spec rewrites was caught by pre-mortem.

### Step 6: Write Plan Document

**Write to:** `.agents/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<goal-slug>.md`

```markdown
---
id: plan-YYYY-MM-DD-<goal-slug>
type: plan
date: YYYY-MM-DD
source: "[[.agents/research/YYYY-MM-DD-<research-slug>]]"
---

# Plan: <Goal>

## Context
<1-2 paragraphs explaining the problem, current state, and why this change is needed. Include `Applied findings: <id, id, ...>` from `.agents/planning-rules/*.md` first, with `.agents/findings/registry.jsonl` as fallback.>

Applied findings:
- `<finding-id>` — `<how it changed the plan>`

## Files to Modify

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `path/to/file.go` | Description of change |
| `path/to/new_file.go` | **NEW** — description |

## Boundaries

**Always:** <non-negotiable requirements — security, backward compat, testing, etc.>
**Ask First:** <decisions needing human input before proceeding — in auto mode, logged only>
**Never:** <explicit out-of-scope items preventing scope creep>

## Baseline Audit

| Metric | Command | Result |
|--------|---------|--------|
| <what was measured> | `<grep/wc/ls command used>` | <result> |

## Implementation

### 1. <Change Group Name>

In `path/to/file.go`:

- **Modify `functionName`**: Add `paramName Type` parameter. If `paramName != ""` and condition, return `"value"`.

- **Add `NewStruct`**:
  ```go
  type NewStruct struct {
      FieldName string `json:"field_name,omitempty"`
  }
  ```

- **Key functions to reuse:**
  - `existingHelper()` at `path/to/file.go:123`
  - `anotherFunc()` at `path/to/other.go:456`

### 2. <Next Change Group>

<Same pattern — exact symbols, inline code, reuse references>

## Tests

**`path/to/file_test.go`** — add:
- `TestFunctionName_ScenarioA`: Input X produces output Y
- `TestFunctionName_ScenarioB`: Edge case Z handled correctly

**`path/to/new_test.go`** — **NEW**:
- `TestNewFeature_HappyPath`: Normal flow succeeds
- `TestNewFeature_ErrorCase`: Bad input returns error

## Conformance Checks

| Issue | Check Type | Check |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Issue 1 | content_check | `{file: "src/auth.go", pattern: "func Authenticate"}` |
| Issue 1 | tests | `go test ./src/auth/...` |
| Issue 2 | files_exist | `["docs/api-v2.md"]` |

## Verification

1. **Unit tests**: `go test ./path/to/ -run "TestFoo" -v`
2. **Full suite**: `go test ./... -short -timeout 120s`
3. **Manual simulation**:
   ```bash
   # Create test scenario
   mkdir -p .test/data
   echo '{"key": "value"}' > .test/data/input.json
   # Run the tool
   ./bin/tool --flag value
   # Verify expected output
   cat .test/data/output.json  # Should show "result"
   ```

## Issues

### Issue 1: <Title>
**Dependencies:** None
**Acceptance:** <how to verify>
**Description:** <what to do — reference Implementation section for symbol-level detail>

### Issue 2: <Title>
**Dependencies:** Issue 1
**Acceptance:** <how to verify>
**Description:** <what to do>

## Execution Order

**Wave 1** (parallel): Issue 1, Issue 3
**Wave 2** (after Wave 1): Issue 2, Issue 4
**Wave 3** (after Wave 2): Issue 5

## Post-Merge Cleanup

After bulk-merging wave results, audit for scaffold-era names:
- Rename placeholder function/variable names (e.g., `handleThing`, `processItem`) to domain-specific names
- Search with `grep -rn 'TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|XXX' <modified-files>` for deferred cleanup markers

## Next Steps
- Run `/pre-mortem` to validate plan
- Run `/crank` for autonomous execution
- Or `/implement <issue>` for single issue
```

### Step 7: Create Tasks for In-Session Tracking

**Use TaskCreate tool** for each issue:

```
Tool: TaskCreate
Parameters:
  subject: "<issue title>"
  description: |
    <Full description including:>
    - What to do
    - Acceptance criteria
    - Dependencies: [list task IDs that must complete first]
  activeForm: "<-ing verb form of the task>"
```

**After creating all tasks, set up dependencies:**

```
Tool: TaskUpdate
Parameters:
  taskId: "<task-id>"
  addBlockedBy: ["<dependency-task-id>"]
```

**IMPORTANT: Create persistent issues for ratchet tracking:**

If bd CLI available, create beads issues to enable progress tracking across sessions:
```bash
# Create epic first
bd create --title "<goal>" --type epic --label "planned"

# Create child issues (note the IDs returned)
bd create --title "<wave-1-task>" --body "<description>" --parent <epic-id> --label "planned"
# Returns: na-0001

bd create --title "<wave-2-task-depends-on-wave-1>" --body "<description>" --parent <epic-id> --label "planned"
# Returns: na-0002

# Add blocking dependencies to form waves
bd dep add na-0001 na-0002
# Now na-0002 is blocked by na-0001 → Wave 2
```

**Include conformance checks in issue bodies:**

When creating beads issues, embed the conformance checks from the plan as a fenced validation block in the issue description. This flows to worker validation metadata via /crank:

````
bd create --title "<task>" --body "Description...

\`\`\`validation
{\"files_exist\": [\"src/auth.go\"], \"content_check\": {\"file\": \"src/auth.go\", \"pattern\": \"func Authenticate\"}}
\`\`\`
" --parent <epic-id>
````

**Include cross-cutting constraints in epic description:**

"Always" boundaries from the plan should be added to the epic's description as a `## Cross-Cutting Constraints` section. /crank reads these from the epic (not per-issue) and injects them into every worker task's validation metadata.

**Waves are formed by `blocks` dependencies:**
- Issues with NO blockers → Wave 1 (appear in `bd ready` immediately)
- Issues blocked by Wave 1 → Wave 2 (appear when Wave 1 closes)
- Issues blocked by Wave 2 → Wave 3 (appear when Wave 2 closes)

**`bd ready` returns the current wave** - all unblocked issues that can run in parallel.

Without bd issues, the ratchet validator cannot track gate progress. This is required for `/crank` autonomous execution and `/post-mortem` validation.

### Step 7b: Verify Validation Blocks (Post-Creation Check)

After creating all beads issues, verify that every issue body contains a fenced validation block. Missing validation blocks break the plan-to-crank pipeline — `/crank` cannot extract conformance checks from issues that lack them.

```bash
if command -v bd &>/dev/null && [[ -n "$EPIC_ID" ]]; then
    MISSING_VALIDATION=()
    for ISSUE_ID in $ALL_CREATED_ISSUES; do
        if ! bd show "$ISSUE_ID" 2>/dev/null | grep -q '```validation'; then
            MISSING_VALIDATION+=("$ISSUE_ID")
        fi
    done
    if [[ ${#MISSING_VALIDATION[@]} -gt 0 ]]; then
        echo "WARNING: ${#MISSING_VALIDATION[@]} issue(s) missing validation blocks: ${MISSING_VALIDATION[*]}"
        echo "  /crank will fall back to default files_exist checks for these issues."
        echo "  Consider adding ```validation``` blocks with conformance checks."
    else
        echo "All ${#ALL_CREATED_ISSUES[@]} issues have validation blocks."
    fi
fi
```

This is a warning gate, not a blocker — plans can proceed without validation blocks, but crank execution will use weaker fallback checks.

### Step 8: Request Human Approval (Gate 2)

**Skip this step if `--auto` flag is set.** In auto mode, proceed directly to Step 9.

**USE AskUserQuestion tool:**

```
Tool: AskUserQuestion
Parameters:
  questions:
    - question: "Plan complete with N tasks in M waves. Approve to proceed?"
      header: "Gate 2"
      options:
        - label: "Approve"
          description: "Proceed to /pre-mortem or /crank"
        - label: "Revise"
          description: "Modify the plan before proceeding"
        - label: "Back to Research"
          description: "Need more research before planning"
      multiSelect: false
```

**Wait for approval before reporting completion.**

### Step 9: Record Ratchet Progress

```bash
ao ratchet record plan 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Step 10: Report to User

Tell the user:
1. Plan document location
2. Number of issues identified
3. Wave structure for parallel execution
4. Tasks created (in-session task IDs)
5. Next step: `/pre-mortem` for failure simulation, then `/crank` for execution

## Key Rules

- **Read research first** if it exists
- **Explore codebase** to understand current state
- **Identify dependencies** between issues
- **Compute waves** for parallel execution
- **Always write the plan** to `.agents/plans/`

## Examples

### Plan from Research

**User says:** `/plan "add user authentication"`

**What happens:**
1. Agent reads recent research from `.agents/research/2026-02-13-authentication-system.md`
2. Explores codebase to identify integration points
3. Decomposes into 5 issues: middleware, session store, token validation, tests, docs
4. Creates epic `ag-5k2` with 5 child issues in 2 waves
5. Output written to `.agents/plans/2026-02-13-add-user-authentication.md`

**Result:** Epic with dependency graph, conformance checks, and wave structure for parallel execution.

### Plan with Auto Mode

**User says:** `/plan --auto "refactor payment module"`

**What happens:**
1. Agent skips human approval gates
2. Searches knowledge base for refactoring patterns
3. Creates epic and child issues automatically
4. Records ratchet progress

**Result:** Fully autonomous plan creation with 3 waves, 8 issues, ready for `/crank`.

### Plan Cleanup Epic with Audit

**User says:** `/plan "remove dead code"`

**What happens:**
1. Agent runs quantitative audit: 3,003 LOC across 3 packages
2. Creates issues grounded in audit numbers (not vague "cleanup")
3. Each issue specifies exact files and line count reduction
4. Output includes deletion verification checks

**Result:** Scoped cleanup plan with measurable completion criteria (e.g., "Delete 1,500 LOC from pkg/legacy").

### Plan with Implementation Detail (Symbol-Level)

**User says:** `/plan "add stale run detection to RPI status"` (external operator loop surface)

**What happens:**
1. Agent explores codebase, finds `classifyRunStatus` at `rpi_status.go:850`, `phasedState` at `rpi_phased.go:100`
2. Produces file inventory: 4 files to modify, 2 new files
3. Each implementation section names exact functions, parameters, struct fields with JSON tags
4. Tests section lists `TestClassifyRunStatus_StaleWorktree`, `TestDetermineRunLiveness_MissingWorktree` with descriptions
5. Verification section provides manual simulation: create fake stale run, check the external RPI status surface output

**Result:** Implementer can execute the plan in a single pass without rediscovering any symbol names, reducing implementation time by ~50% and eliminating spec-divergence rework.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| bd create fails | Beads not initialized in repo | Run `bd init --prefix <prefix>` first |
| Dependencies not created | Issues created without explicit `bd dep add` calls | Verify plan output includes dependency commands. Re-run to regenerate |
| Plan too large | Research scope was too broad, resulting in >20 issues | Narrow the goal or split into multiple epics |
| Wave structure incorrect | False dependencies declared (logical ordering, not file conflicts) | Review dependency necessity: does blocked issue modify blocker's files? |
| Conformance checks missing | Acceptance criteria not mechanically verifiable | Add `files_exist`, `content_check`, `tests`, or `command` checks per validation-contract.md |
| Epic has no children | Plan created but bd commands failed silently | Check `bd list --type epic` output; re-run plan with bd CLI available |
