# Seven Compiled Planning Rules

> Extracted from 14,753 production sessions, 544,906 messages, 946 council verdicts (124 FAILs analyzed).
> These rules are the top cross-cutting failure patterns — each prevented by a specific planning discipline.

## How to Use

During plan creation (Step 2), evaluate each issue and wave against all 7 rules. For each rule, ask the Detection Question. If the answer is "no" or "unclear," add a mitigation to the plan before proceeding.

---

## PR-001: Mechanical Enforcement

**Rule:** Every silent-failure risk needs a gate (test, lint, or validation) that mechanically prevents it. Plans must not rely on human vigilance for correctness.

**Evidence:** ArgoCD CMP timeout mismatch caused cache poisoning with no gate to enforce alignment. K8s status subresource omission caused invisible data loss. SSH parameter parity failures in retry paths silently diverged.

**Detection Question:** Does every integration point, timeout, and configuration boundary have a mechanical validation gate?

**Checklist Item:** Each external dependency and configuration boundary has an automated conformance check (test, lint rule, or CI gate).

---

## PR-002: External Validation

**Rule:** Success criteria must be external and measurable. Workers must not declare their own work complete — external gates (tests, validators, reviewers) must confirm.

**Evidence:** Ralph Loop uses test gates, not agent declarations. Zero-context smoke tests find 3–5x more issues than self-review. Unit tests found zero bugs in production; L3+ testing (integration, E2E) found all real bugs.

**Detection Question:** Does the plan use external validation gates (test commands, CI checks) rather than self-reported completion?

**Checklist Item:** Every task has a runnable validation command — no "verify manually" acceptance criteria.

---

## PR-003: Feedback Loops

**Rule:** Any system that captures knowledge without a citation/reuse mechanism is a cemetery. Plans must include how outputs will be consumed, not just produced.

**Evidence:** Knowledge flywheel formula: velocity (σ) × reuse (ρ) must exceed decay (δ). Platform-lab flywheel decaying at σ=0.02 — producing artifacts nobody consumes. Four-surface closure requires capture → index → retrieval → application.

**Detection Question:** Does the plan close the feedback loop — who consumes the output, how is it cited, and what triggers reuse?

**Checklist Item:** Each output artifact has a named consumer and a defined consumption mechanism.

---

## PR-004: Separation Over Layering

**Rule:** Organize components around clear contracts and boundaries, not hierarchical layers. Each component should have a single, unambiguous responsibility.

**Evidence:** OpenClaw succeeds with horizontal separation (SOUL/AGENTS/IDENTITY own contracts completely). ArgoCD sync waves enforce ordering without external tooling. Prior attempts at adding a third layer with fuzzy boundaries produced unclear ownership and bugs at every seam.

**Detection Question:** Does the plan add layers or separate concerns? Are boundaries between components explicit contracts?

**Checklist Item:** Each new component has a defined contract (input/output/error) specified before implementation begins.

---

## PR-005: Process Gates First

**Rule:** When execution is failing, fix the process first. Model/tool improvements compound only after process is stable.

**Evidence:** 6,367 execution failures solved by process gates, not model upgrades. Pre-worktree sync prevents 82.6/1K git conflicts. Standards guides loaded upfront prevent 13+ violations per session.

**Detection Question:** Is the plan proposing a tool/model change when a process gate would solve the problem?

**Checklist Item:** Existing process gates are verified as in place and enforced before any new tool or model change is proposed.

---

## PR-006: Cross-Layer Consistency

**Rule:** Distributed systems fail when adjacent layers have different assumptions. Enforce consistency explicitly at every boundary.

**Evidence:** ArgoCD 3-layer timeout stack (CMP, repo-server, application) that disagrees causes silent cache poisoning. SSH parameter forwarding through retry paths — primary and retry must carry identical parameters. Plan/tracker/artifacts must stay in lockstep.

**Detection Question:** Does the plan verify configuration consistency across all layers it touches (timeouts, parameters, schemas)?

**Checklist Item:** A consistency check verifies all layers agree on shared parameters (timeouts, schemas, feature flags, env vars).

---

## PR-007: Phased Rollout

**Rule:** Big changes decompose into low-risk immediate wins + moderate-risk follow-ups. Ship the cheap wins first.

**Evidence:** ArgoCD fix order: CMP timeout (low-risk) → replicas (moderate) → Redis HA (evaluate). Swarm gates: Week 1 (sync) → Week 2 (ship gate) → Week 3 (role split) → Week 4 (closeout). Bootstrap: infrastructure → core → applications via sync waves.

**Detection Question:** Is the plan deploying everything at once, or is it phased with risk isolation between waves?

**Checklist Item:** Changes are ordered into waves by risk level, with Wave 1 being the safest and most reversible.

## Quick-Reference Checklist

Use this during plan review:

| # | Rule | Detection Question |
|---|------|--------------------|
| 1 | Mechanical Enforcement | Does every integration point have a mechanical gate? |
| 1b | Mechanical Enforcement | Does the plan include activation tests for any provisioned infrastructure? (Dead infrastructure = provisioned but never tested under real load) |
| 2 | External Validation | Are all validation gates external (not self-reported)? |
| 3 | Feedback Loops | Who consumes each output, and how? |
| 3b | Feedback Loops | Does the plan specify who consumes each output artifact? (Capture without consumption is a knowledge cemetery) |
| 4 | Separation Over Layering | Are component boundaries explicit contracts? |
| 5 | Process Gates First | Could a process gate solve this instead of a tool change? |
| 5b | Process Gates First | Does the plan enforce commit-per-wave and worktree-commit-before-exit? (Branch hygiene prevents merge conflict accumulation) |
| 6 | Cross-Layer Consistency | Do all layers agree on shared parameters? |
| 7 | Phased Rollout | Are changes phased by risk with validation between waves? |
| 7b | Phased Rollout | Is the 40% context budget respected? (Sessions that load >40% context for knowledge leave insufficient room for implementation work) |
