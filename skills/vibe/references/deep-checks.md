### Step 2.4: Compiled Prevention Check

Before reading `.agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl`, load compiled prevention context from `.agents/pre-mortem-checks/*.md` and `.agents/planning-rules/*.md` when they exist. This is the primary reusable-prevention surface for review.

Use the tracked contracts in `docs/contracts/finding-compiler.md` and `docs/contracts/finding-registry.md`:

- prefer compiled pre-mortem checks and planning rules first
- rank by severity, `applicable_when` overlap, language overlap, changed-file overlap, and literal target-text overlap
- keep the ranking order consistent with `/plan` and `/pre-mortem`; do not invent a separate review-only heuristic
- cap at top 5 findings / compiled files
- if compiled outputs are missing, incomplete, or fewer than the matched finding set, fall back to `.agents/findings/registry.jsonl`
- fail open:
  - missing compiled directory or registry -> skip silently
  - empty compiled directory or registry -> skip silently
  - malformed line -> warn and ignore that line
  - unreadable file -> warn once and continue without findings

Include matched entries in the council packet as `known_risks` / checklist context with:
- `id`
- `pattern`
- `detection_question`
- `checklist_item`

### Step 2.5: Prior Findings Check

**Skip if `--quick` (see Step 1.5).**

Read `.agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl` and find unconsumed items with `severity=high` that match the target area. Include them in the council packet as `context.prior_findings` so judges have carry-forward context.

Treat these high-severity queue items as part of the same ranked packet used earlier in discovery/plan/pre-mortem. The review stage should inherit and refine prior findings context, not restart retrieval from scratch.

```bash
# Count unconsumed high-severity items
if [ -f .agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl ] && command -v jq &>/dev/null; then
  prior_count=$(jq -s '[.[] | select(.consumed == false) | .items[] | select(.severity == "high")] | length' \
    .agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
  if [ "$prior_count" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "Prior findings: $prior_count unconsumed high-severity items from next-work.jsonl"
    jq -s '[.[] | select(.consumed == false) | .items[] | select(.severity == "high")]' \
      .agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl 2>/dev/null
  fi
fi
```

If unconsumed high-severity items are found, include them in the council packet context:
```json
"prior_findings": {
  "source": ".agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl",
  "count": 3,
  "items": [/* array of high-severity unconsumed items */]
}
```

**Skip conditions:**
- `--quick` mode → skip
- `.agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl` does not exist → skip silently
- `jq` not on PATH → skip silently
- No unconsumed high-severity items found → skip (do not add empty `prior_findings` to packet)

### Step 2a: Run Constraint Tests

**Skip if `--quick` (see Step 1.5).**

**If the project has constraint tests, run them before council:**

```bash
# Check if constraint tests exist (Olympus pattern)
if [ -d "internal/constraints" ] && ls internal/constraints/*_test.go &>/dev/null; then
  echo "Running constraint tests..."
  go test ./internal/constraints/ -run TestConstraint -v 2>&1
  # If FAIL → include failures in council context as CRITICAL findings
  # If PASS → note "N constraint tests passed" in report
fi
```

**Why:** Constraint tests catch mechanical violations (ghost references, TOCTOU races, dead code at entry points) that council judges miss. Proven by Argus ghost ref in ol-571 — council gave PASS while constraint test caught it.

Include constraint test results in the council packet context. Failed constraint tests are CRITICAL findings that override council PASS verdict.

### Step 2b: Metadata Verification Checklist (MANDATORY)

**Skip if `--quick` (see Step 1.5).**

Run mechanical checks BEFORE council — catches errors LLMs estimate instead of measure:
1. **File existence** — every path in `git diff --name-only HEAD~3` must exist on disk
2. **Line counts** — if a file claims "N lines", verify with `wc -l`
3. **Cross-references** — internal markdown links resolve to existing files
4. **Diagram sanity** — files with >3 ASCII boxes should have matching labels

Include failures in council packet as `context.metadata_failures` (MECHANICAL findings). If all pass, note in report.

### Step 2c: Deterministic Validation (Olympus)

**Skip if `--quick` (see Step 1.5).**

**Guard:** Only run when `.ol/config.yaml` exists AND `which ol` succeeds. Skip silently otherwise.

**Implementation:**

```bash
# Run ol-validate.sh
skills/vibe/scripts/ol-validate.sh
ol_exit_code=$?

case $ol_exit_code in
  0)
    # Passed: include the validation report in vibe output
    echo "✅ Deterministic validation passed"
    # Append the report section to council context and vibe report
    ;;
  1)
    # Failed: abort vibe with FAIL verdict
    echo "❌ Deterministic validation FAILED"
    echo "VIBE FAILED — Olympus Stage1 validation did not pass"
    exit 1
    ;;
  2)
    # Skipped: note and continue
    echo "⚠️ OL validation skipped"
    # Continue to council
    ;;
esac
```

**Behavior:**
- **Exit 0 (passed):** Include the validation report section in vibe output and council context. Proceed normally.
- **Exit 1 (failed):** Auto-FAIL the vibe. Do NOT proceed to council.
- **Exit 2 (skipped):** Note "OL validation skipped" in report. Proceed to council.

### Step 2d: Codex Review (opt-in via `--mixed`)

**Skip unless `--mixed` is passed.** Also skip if `--quick` (see Step 1.5).

Codex review is opt-in because it adds 30–60s latency and token cost. Users explicitly request cross-vendor input with `--mixed`.

```bash
echo "$(date -Iseconds) preflight: checking codex" >> .agents/council/preflight.log
if which codex >> .agents/council/preflight.log 2>&1; then
  codex review --uncommitted > .agents/council/codex-review-pre.md 2>&1 && \
    echo "Codex review complete — output at .agents/council/codex-review-pre.md" || \
    echo "Codex review skipped (failed)"
else
  echo "Codex review skipped (CLI not found)"
fi
```

**If output exists**, summarize and include in council packet (cap at 2000 chars to prevent context bloat):
```json
"codex_review": {
  "source": "codex review --uncommitted",
  "content": "<first 2000 chars of .agents/council/codex-review-pre.md>"
}
```

**IMPORTANT:** The raw codex review can be 50k+ chars. Including the full text in every judge's packet multiplies token cost by N judges. Truncate to the first 2000 chars (covers the summary and top findings). Judges can read the full file from disk if they need more detail.

This gives council judges a Codex-generated review as pre-existing context — cheap, fast, diff-focused. It does NOT replace council judgment; it augments it.

**Skip conditions:**
- `--mixed` not passed → skip (opt-in only)
- Codex CLI not on PATH → skip silently
- `codex review` fails → skip silently, proceed with council only
- No uncommitted changes → skip (nothing to review)

### Step 2e: Search Knowledge Flywheel

**Skip if `--quick` (see Step 1.5).**

```bash
if command -v ao &>/dev/null; then
    ao search "code review findings <target>" 2>/dev/null | head -10
fi
```
If ao returns prior code review patterns for this area, include them in the council packet context. Skip silently if ao is unavailable or returns no results.

### Step 2f: Bug Hunt or Deep Audit Sweep

**Skip if `--quick` (see Step 1.5).**

**Path A — Deep Audit Sweep (`--deep` or `--sweep`):**

Read `references/deep-audit-protocol.md` for the full protocol. In summary:

1. Chunk target files into batches of 3–5 (by line count — see protocol for rules)
2. Dispatch up to 8 Explore agents in parallel, each with a mandatory 8-category checklist per file
3. Merge all explorer findings into a sweep manifest at `.agents/council/sweep-manifest.md`
4. Include sweep manifest in council packet (judges shift to adjudication mode — see Step 4)

**Why:** Generalist judges exhibit satisfaction bias — they stop at ~10 findings regardless of actual issue count. Per-file explorers with category checklists eliminate this bias and find 3x more issues in a single pass.

**Path B — Lightweight Bug Hunt (default, no `--deep`/`--sweep`):**

Run a proactive bug hunt on the target files before council review:

```
/bug-hunt --audit <target>
```

If bug-hunt produces findings, include them in the council packet as `context.bug_hunt`:
```json
"bug_hunt": {
  "source": "/bug-hunt --audit",
  "findings_count": 3,
  "high": 1,
  "medium": 1,
  "low": 1,
  "summary": "<first 2000 chars of bug hunt report>"
}
```

**Why:** Bug hunt catches concrete line-level bugs (resource leaks, truncation errors, dead code) that council judges — reviewing holistically — often miss.

**Skip conditions (both paths):**
- `--quick` mode → skip (fast path)
- No source files in target → skip (nothing to audit)
- Target is non-code (pure docs/config) → skip

### Step 2h: Check for Product Context

**Skip if `--quick` (see Step 1.5).**

```bash
if [ -f PRODUCT.md ]; then
  # PRODUCT.md exists — include developer-experience perspectives
fi
```

When `PRODUCT.md` exists in the project root AND the user did NOT pass an explicit `--preset` override:
1. Read `PRODUCT.md` content and include in the council packet via `context.files`
2. Add a single consolidated `developer-experience` perspective to the council invocation:
   - **With spec:** `/council --preset=code-review --perspectives="developer-experience" validate <target>` (3 judges: 2 code-review + 1 DX)
   - **Without spec:** `/council --perspectives="developer-experience" validate <target>` (3 judges: 2 independent + 1 DX)
   The DX judge covers api-clarity, error-experience, and discoverability in a single review.
3. With `--deep`: adds 1 more judge per mode (4 judges total).

When `PRODUCT.md` exists BUT the user passed an explicit `--preset`: skip DX auto-include (user's explicit preset takes precedence).

When `PRODUCT.md` does not exist: proceed to Step 3 unchanged.

> **Tip:** Create `PRODUCT.md` from `docs/PRODUCT-TEMPLATE.md` to enable developer-experience-aware code review.

### Step 3: Load the Spec (New)

**Skip if `--quick` (see Step 1.5).**

Before invoking council, try to find the relevant spec/bead:

1. **If target looks like a bead ID** (e.g., `na-0042`): `bd show <id>` to get the spec
2. **Search for plan doc:** `ls .agents/plans/ | grep <target-keyword>`
3. **Check git log:** `git log --oneline | head -10` to find the relevant bead reference

If a spec is found, include it in the council packet's `context.spec` field:
```json
{
  "spec": {
    "source": "bead na-0042",
    "content": "<the spec/bead description text>"
  }
}
```

### Step 3.5: Load Suppressions

Before invoking council, load the default suppression list from `references/vibe-suppressions.md` and any project-level overrides from `.agents/vibe-suppressions.jsonl`. Suppressions are applied post-verdict to classify findings as CRITICAL vs INFORMATIONAL and to filter known false positives. See [references/vibe-suppressions.md](vibe-suppressions.md) for the full pattern list.

### Step 3.6: Load Pre-Mortem Predictions (Correlation)

When a pre-mortem report exists for the current epic, load prediction IDs for downstream correlation:

```bash
# Find the most recent pre-mortem report
PM_REPORT=$(ls -t .agents/council/*pre-mortem*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
if [ -n "$PM_REPORT" ]; then
  # Extract prediction IDs from frontmatter
  PREDICTION_IDS=$(sed -n '/^prediction_ids:/,/^[^ -]/p' "$PM_REPORT" | grep '^\s*-' | sed 's/^\s*- //')
fi
```

For each vibe finding, check if it matches a pre-mortem prediction:
- **Match found:** Tag finding with `predicted_by: pm-YYYYMMDD-NNN`
- **No match:** Tag finding with `predicted_by: none` (surprise issue)

Include the prediction correlation in the vibe report's findings table. This feeds the post-mortem's Prediction Accuracy section. Skip silently if no pre-mortem report exists.

### Model Cost Tiers

Vibe passes the model cost tier through to council for all validation calls. Tier resolution:

1. Explicit `--tier=<name>` flag on `/vibe`
2. Skill-specific config: `models.skill_overrides.vibe` in `.agentops/config.yaml`
3. Global default: `models.default_tier` in `.agentops/config.yaml`
4. Built-in default: `balanced`

```yaml
# Example: force quality tier for all vibe reviews
models:
  skill_overrides:
    vibe: quality
```
