# RPI Workflow

You have access to workflow skills for structured development.

## The RPI Workflow

```
Research → Plan → Implement → Validate
    ↑                            │
    └──── Knowledge Flywheel ────┘
```

### Research Phase

```bash
/research <topic>      # Deep codebase exploration
ao search "<query>"    # Search existing knowledge
ao lookup <id>         # Pull full content of specific learning
ao lookup --query "x"  # Search knowledge by relevance
```

**Output:** `.agents/research/<topic>.md`

### Plan Phase

```bash
/pre-mortem <spec>     # Simulate failures before implementing
/plan <goal>           # Decompose into trackable issues
```

**Output:** Beads issues with dependencies

### Implement Phase

```bash
/implement <issue>     # Single issue execution
/crank <epic>          # Autonomous epic loop (uses swarm for waves)
/swarm                 # Parallel execution (fresh context per agent)
```

**Output:** Code changes, tests, documentation

### Validate Phase

```bash
/vibe [target]         # Code validation (security, quality, architecture)
/post-mortem           # Full validation + knowledge extraction (council + learnings + activation)
/retro                 # Quick-capture a single learning
```

**Output:** `.agents/learnings/`, `.agents/patterns/`

### Release Phase

```bash
/release [version]     # Full release: changelog + bump + commit + tag
/release --check       # Readiness validation only (GO/NO-GO)
/release --dry-run     # Preview without writing
```

**Output:** Updated CHANGELOG.md, version bumps, git tag, `.agents/releases/`

## Phase-to-Skill Mapping

| Phase | Primary Skill | Supporting Skills |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Research** | `/research` | `/inject` |
| **Plan** | `/plan` | `/pre-mortem` |
| **Implement** | `/implement` | `/crank` (epic loop), `/swarm` (parallel execution) |
| **Validate** | `/vibe` | `/post-mortem` (full retro + knowledge lifecycle), `/retro` (quick-capture) |
| **Release** | `/release` | — |

**Choosing the skill:**
- Use `/implement` for **single issue** execution. **Now defaults to TDD-first** — writes failing tests before implementing. Skip with `--no-tdd`.
- Use `/crank` for **autonomous epic execution** (loops waves via swarm until done). Auto-generates file-ownership maps to prevent worker conflicts.
- Use `/swarm` directly for **parallel execution** without beads (TaskList only).
- Use `/rpi` for **full lifecycle** with optional `--budget` flag for phase time guards (e.g., `--budget=research:180,plan:120`).
- Use `/ratchet` to **gate/record progress** through RPI.

## Knowledge Flywheel

Every `/post-mortem` feeds back to `/research`:

1. **Learnings** extracted → `.agents/learnings/`
2. **Patterns** discovered → `.agents/patterns/`
3. **Research** enriched → Future sessions benefit

## Issue Tracking

This workflow uses beads for git-native issue tracking:

```bash
bd ready              # Unblocked issues
bd show <id>          # Issue details
bd close <id>         # Close issue
bd sync               # Sync with git
```

## Examples

### SessionStart Context Loading

**Hook triggers:** `session-start.sh` runs at session start

**What happens:**
1. In `manual` mode (default): MEMORY.md is auto-loaded by Claude Code; hook emits a pointer to on-demand retrieval (`ao search`, `ao lookup`)
2. In `lean` mode: hook extracts pending knowledge and injects prior learnings with a reduced token budget
3. Hook injects this skill automatically into session context
4. Agent loads RPI workflow overview, phase-to-skill mapping, trigger patterns
5. User says "check my code" → agent recognizes `/vibe` trigger naturally

**Result:** Agent knows the full skill catalog and workflow from session start. MEMORY.md is auto-loaded by default (`manual` mode). Set `AGENTOPS_STARTUP_CONTEXT_MODE=lean` for automatic knowledge injection alongside MEMORY.md.

### Workflow Reference During Planning

**User says:** "How should I approach this feature?"

**What happens:**
1. Agent references this skill's RPI workflow section
2. Agent recommends Research → Plan → Implement → Validate phases
3. Agent suggests `/research` for codebase exploration, `/plan` for decomposition
4. Agent explains `/pre-mortem` for failure simulation before implementation
5. User follows recommended workflow with agent guidance

**Result:** Agent provides structured workflow guidance based on this meta-skill, avoiding ad-hoc approaches.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Skill not auto-loaded | Hook not configured or SessionStart disabled | Verify hooks/session-start.sh exists; check hook enable flags |
| Outdated skill catalog | This file not synced with actual skills/ directory | Update skill list in this file after adding/removing skills |
| Wrong skill suggested | Natural language trigger ambiguous | User explicitly calls skill with `/skill-name` syntax |
| Workflow unclear | RPI phases not well-documented here | Read full workflow guide in README.md or docs/ARCHITECTURE.md |
