| pm-YYYYMMDD-001 | Missing-Requirements | ... | significant | <what will go wrong> |

## Pseudocode Fixes

**Every finding that implies a code change MUST include implementation-ready pseudocode**, not prose-only descriptions. Write the pseudocode in the language of the target file. Workers read issue descriptions, not pre-mortem reports — vague prose leads to workers reimplementing the bug.

Format each code-fix finding as:

    Finding: F1 — <concise description>
    Severity: <severity>
    Fix (pseudocode):
      ```<language>
      // pseudocode in the target file's language
      if tier == "inherit" || tier == "" {
          return "balanced"  // inherit always resolves to balanced
      }
      ```
    Affected files: <path(s)>

Prose-only fix descriptions (e.g., "The inherit tier should fall back to balanced") are insufficient when the fix involves specific logic. If a finding is purely architectural or process-related with no code change, prose is acceptable.

## Shared Findings
- ...

## Known Risks Applied
- `<finding-id>` — `<why it matched this plan>`

## Concerns Raised
- ...

## Recommendation
<council recommendation>

## Decision Gate

[ ] PROCEED - Council passed, ready to implement
[ ] ADDRESS - Fix concerns before implementing
[ ] RETHINK - Fundamental issues, needs redesign
```

Each finding gets a unique prediction ID (`pm-YYYYMMDD-NNN`) for downstream correlation. See [prediction-tracking.md](prediction-tracking.md) for the full tracking lifecycle.

## Step 4.5: Persist Reusable Findings

If the verdict is `WARN` or `FAIL`, persist only the reusable plan/spec failures to `.agents/findings/registry.jsonl`.

Use the finding-registry contract:

- required fields: `dedup_key`, provenance, `pattern`, `detection_question`, `checklist_item`, `applicable_when`, `confidence`
- `applicable_when` must use the controlled vocabulary from the contract
- append or merge by `dedup_key`
- use the contract's temp-file-plus-rename atomic write rule

Do NOT write every comment. Persist only findings that should change future planning or review behavior.

After the registry update, if `hooks/finding-compiler.sh` exists, run:

```bash
bash hooks/finding-compiler.sh --quiet 2>/dev/null || true
```

This refreshes `.agents/findings/*.md`, `.agents/planning-rules/*.md`, `.agents/pre-mortem-checks/*.md`, and draft constraint metadata in the same session. `session-end-maintenance.sh` remains the idempotent backstop.

## Step 4.6: Copy Pseudocode Fixes into Plan Issues

When pre-mortem findings are applied to plan issues (via `TaskUpdate`, `bd update`, or manual edit), **copy the pseudocode block verbatim into the issue body**. Workers read issue descriptions — they do not read pre-mortem reports. If the pseudocode lives only in the pre-mortem report, workers will reimplement the fix from scratch and often get it wrong.

For each finding with a pseudocode fix:

1. Identify which plan issue the finding applies to
2. Append a `## Pre-Mortem Fix` section to that issue's description containing the pseudocode block and affected file paths
3. If no matching issue exists, note the gap in the report's Recommendation section
