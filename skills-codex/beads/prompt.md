# beads

Operate issue workflows with Codex-friendly execution and clear dependency control.

## Codex Execution Profile

1. Treat `skills/beads/SKILL.md` as canonical issue-tracking contract.
2. Treat live `bd` reads (`bd ready`, `bd show`, `bd export`) as authoritative over `.beads/issues.jsonl`.
3. Keep issue updates tightly coupled to implementation state changes.
4. After tracker mutations, refresh tracked `.beads/issues.jsonl`, inspect `bd vc status`, commit Dolt changes if pending, and only push Dolt when a remote is configured.
5. Reconcile broad parents and stale parent notes after child closure instead of leaving umbrella beads stale.

## Guardrails

1. Avoid runtime-specific assistant assumptions in operator instructions.
2. Ensure dependency direction is explicit whenever adding `bd dep` edges.
3. Require acceptance and validation details in issue descriptions for executable handoff.
4. Do not route execution from stale queue items without normalizing them to the actual remaining gap.
