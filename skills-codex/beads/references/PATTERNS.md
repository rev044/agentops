## Knowledge Work Session

**Scenario**: User asks "Help me write a proposal for expanding the analytics platform"

**What you see**:
```bash
$ bd ready
# Returns: bd-42 "Research analytics platform expansion proposal" (in_progress)

$ bd show bd-42
Notes: "COMPLETED: Reviewed current stack (Mixpanel, Amplitude)
IN PROGRESS: Drafting cost-benefit analysis section
NEXT: Need user input on budget constraints before finalizing recommendations"
```

**What you do**:
1. Read notes to understand current state
2. Create Task tools for immediate work:
   ```
   - [ ] Draft cost-benefit analysis
   - [ ] Ask user about budget constraints
   - [ ] Finalize recommendations
   ```
3. Work on tasks, mark Task tools items completed
4. At milestone, update bd notes:
   ```bash
   bd update bd-42 --notes "COMPLETED: Cost-benefit analysis drafted.
   KEY DECISION: User confirmed $50k budget cap - ruled out enterprise options.
   IN PROGRESS: Finalizing recommendations (Posthog + custom ETL).
   NEXT: Get user review of draft before closing issue."
   ```

**Outcome**: Task tools disappears at session end, but bd notes preserve context for next session.

**Key insight**: Notes field captures the "why" and context, Task tools tracks the "doing" right now.

## Broad Parent Narrowing

**Scenario**: `bd ready` surfaces a parent bead that is still open but now only some narrower gap remains.

**Pattern**:
1. Read the parent live with `bd show <parent-id>`
2. Identify the exact remaining gap instead of coding against the broad title
3. Create or update a child bead for that concrete gap
4. Implement against the child bead
5. Reconcile the parent's notes and status immediately after the child lands

**Example**:
```bash
bd ready
# Returns: pl-vnu.5 "Tracker workflow friction"

bd show pl-vnu.5
# Notes reveal only one concrete remaining gap: export hygiene after tracker writes

bd create "Refresh tracked issues.jsonl after tracker mutations" -t task -p 1 --parent pl-vnu.5
# or: bd dep add <child-id> --type parent-child --blocked-by pl-vnu.5
bd update <child-id> --status in_progress
# execute work against child
bd close <child-id> --reason "files: .beads/issues.jsonl export guidance; validation: bd export -o .beads/issues.jsonl; parent: pl-vnu.5 still has Dolt remote handling gap"
bd update pl-vnu.5 --notes "Remaining gap is now narrowed to Dolt remote handling"
```

**Why this works**: The parent remains a coordination container, while the child is the executable unit of work.

---

## Side Quest Handling

**Scenario**: During main task, discover a problem that needs attention.

**Pattern**:
1. Create issue immediately: `bd create "Found: inventory system needs refactoring"`
2. Link provenance: `bd dep add main-task new-issue --type discovered-from`
3. Assess urgency: blocker or can defer?
4. **If blocker**:
   - `bd update main-task --status blocked`
   - `bd update new-issue --status in_progress`
   - Work on the blocker
5. **If deferrable**:
   - Note in new issue's design field
   - Continue main task
   - New issue persists for later

**Why this works**: Captures context immediately (before forgetting), preserves relationship to main work, allows flexible prioritization.

**Example (with MCP):**

Working on "Implement checkout flow" (checkout-1), discover payment validation security hole:

1. Create bug issue: `mcp__plugin_beads_beads__create` with `{title: "Fix: payment validation bypasses card expiry check", type: "bug", priority: 0}`
2. Link discovery: `mcp__plugin_beads_beads__dep` with `{from_issue: "checkout-1", to_issue: "payment-bug-2", type: "discovered-from"}`
3. Block current work: `mcp__plugin_beads_beads__update` with `{issue_id: "checkout-1", status: "blocked", notes: "Blocked by payment-bug-2: security hole in validation"}`
4. Start new work: `mcp__plugin_beads_beads__update` with `{issue_id: "payment-bug-2", status: "in_progress"}`

(CLI: `bd create "Fix: payment validation..." -t bug -p 0` then `bd dep add` and `bd update` commands)

---

## Multi-Session Project Resume

**Scenario**: Starting work after days or weeks away from a project.

**Pattern (with MCP)**:
1. **Check what's ready**: Use `mcp__plugin_beads_beads__ready` to see available work
2. **Check what's stuck**: Use `mcp__plugin_beads_beads__blocked` to understand blockers
3. **Check recent progress**: Use `mcp__plugin_beads_beads__list` with `status:"closed"` to see completions
4. **Read detailed context**: Use `mcp__plugin_beads_beads__show` for the issue you'll work on
5. **Update status**: Use `mcp__plugin_beads_beads__update` with `status:"in_progress"`
6. **Begin work**: Create Task tools from notes field's NEXT section

(CLI: `bd ready`, `bd blocked`, `bd list --status closed`, `bd show <id>`, `bd update <id> --status in_progress`)

**Example**:
```bash
$ bd ready
Ready to work on (3):
  auth-5: "Add OAuth refresh token rotation" (priority: 0)
  api-12: "Document REST API endpoints" (priority: 1)
  test-8: "Add integration tests for payment flow" (priority: 2)

$ bd show auth-5
Title: Add OAuth refresh token rotation
Status: open
Priority: 0 (critical)

Notes:
COMPLETED: Basic JWT auth working
IN PROGRESS: Need to add token refresh
NEXT: Implement rotation per OWASP guidelines (7-day refresh tokens)
BLOCKER: None - ready to proceed

$ bd update auth-5 --status in_progress
# Now create Task tools based on NEXT section
```

## Status Transitions

Understanding when to change issue status.

### Status Lifecycle

```
open → in_progress → closed
  ↓         ↓
blocked   blocked
```

### When to Use Each Status

**open** (default):
- Issue created but not started
- Waiting for dependencies to clear
- Planned work not yet begun
- **Command**: Issues start as `open` by default

**in_progress**:
- Actively working on this issue right now
- Has been read and understood
- Making commits or changes related to this
- **Command**: `bd update issue-id --status in_progress`
- **When**: Start of work session on this issue

**blocked**:
- Cannot proceed due to external blocker
- Waiting for user input/decision
- Dependency not completed
- Technical blocker discovered
- **Command**: `bd update issue-id --status blocked`
- **When**: Hit a blocker, capture what blocks you in notes
- **Note**: Document blocker in notes field: "BLOCKER: Waiting for API key from ops team"

**closed**:
- Work completed and verified
- Tests passing
- Acceptance criteria met
- **Command**: `bd close issue-id --reason "Implemented with tests passing"`
- **When**: All work done, ready to move on
- **Note**: Issues remain in database, just marked complete

### Transition Examples

**Starting work**:
```bash
bd ready  # See what's available
bd update auth-5 --status in_progress
# Begin working
```

**Hit a blocker**:
```bash
bd update auth-5 --status blocked --notes "BLOCKER: Need OAuth client ID from product team. Emailed Jane on 2025-10-23."
# Switch to different issue or create new work
```

**Unblocking**:
```bash
# Once blocker resolved
bd update auth-5 --status in_progress --notes "UNBLOCKED: Received OAuth credentials. Resuming implementation."
```

**Completing**:
```bash
bd close auth-5 --reason "Implemented OAuth refresh with 7-day rotation. Tests passing. PR #42 merged."
```

## Compaction Recovery

**Scenario**: Conversation history has been compacted. You need to resume work with zero conversation context.

**What survives compaction**:
- All bd issues and notes
- Complete work history
- Dependencies and relationships

**What's lost**:
- Conversation history
- Task tools lists
- Recent discussion

### Recovery Pattern

1. **Check in-progress work**:
   ```bash
   bd list --status in_progress
   ```

2. **Read notes for context**:
   ```bash
   bd show issue-id
   # Read notes field - should explain current state
   ```

3. **Reconstruct Task tools from notes**:
   - COMPLETED section: Done, skip
   - IN PROGRESS section: Current state
   - NEXT section: **This becomes your Task tools list**

4. **Report to user**:
   ```
   "From bd notes: [summary of COMPLETED]. Currently [IN PROGRESS].
   Next steps: [from NEXT]. Should I continue with that?"
   ```

### Example Recovery

**bd show returns**:
```
Issue: bd-42 "OAuth refresh token implementation"
Status: in_progress
Notes:
COMPLETED: Basic JWT validation working (RS256, 1hr access tokens)
KEY DECISION: 7-day refresh tokens per security review
IN PROGRESS: Implementing token rotation endpoint
NEXT: Add rate limiting (5 refresh attempts per 15min), then write tests
BLOCKER: None
```

**Recovery actions**:
1. Read notes, understand context
2. Create Task tools:
   ```
   - [ ] Implement rate limiting on refresh endpoint
   - [ ] Write tests for token rotation
   - [ ] Verify security guidelines met
   ```
3. Report: "From notes: JWT validation is done with 7-day refresh tokens. Currently implementing rotation endpoint. Next: add rate limiting and tests. Should I continue?"
4. Resume work based on user response

## Issue Closure

**Scenario**: Work is complete. How to close properly?

### Closure Checklist

Before closing, verify:
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria met**: All items checked off
- [ ] **Tests passing**: If applicable
- [ ] **Documentation updated**: If needed
- [ ] **Follow-up work filed**: New issues created for discovered work
- [ ] **Key decisions documented**: In notes field

### Closure Pattern

**Minimal closure** (simple tasks):
```bash
bd close task-123 --reason "files: path/to/file; validation: command-that-passed; parent: none"
```

**Detailed closure** (complex work):
```bash
# Update notes with final state
bd update task-123 --notes "COMPLETED: OAuth refresh with 7-day rotation
KEY DECISION: RS256 over HS256 per security review
TESTS: 12 tests passing (auth, rotation, expiry, errors)
FOLLOW-UP: Filed perf-99 for token cleanup job"

# Close with summary
bd close task-123 --reason "files: auth/refresh.go, auth/refresh_test.go; validation: go test ./auth; parent: reconciled"
```

**If the issue was a child bead**:
```bash
bd close <child-id> --reason "files: path/to/changed-file; validation: command-that-passed; parent: <parent-id> reconciled"
bd show <parent-id>
bd update <parent-id> --notes "Remaining gap now ..."   # or close parent if nothing remains
```

**If tracked export exists**:
```bash
bd export -o .beads/issues.jsonl
bd vc status
bd dolt commit -m "tracker: close <child-id>"   # if pending
bd dolt push                                    # only if remote configured
```

### Documenting Resolution (Outcome vs Design)

For issues where the outcome differed from initial design, use `--notes` to document what actually happened:

```bash
# Initial design was hypothesis - document actual outcome in notes
bd update bug-456 --notes "RESOLUTION: Not a bug - behavior is correct per OAuth spec. Documentation was unclear. Filed docs-789 to clarify auth flow in user guide."

bd close bug-456 --reason "Resolved: documentation issue, not bug"
```

**Pattern**: Design field = initial approach. Notes field = what actually happened (prefix with RESOLUTION: for clarity).

### Discovering Follow-up Work

When closing reveals new work:

```bash
# While closing auth feature, realize performance needs work
bd create "Optimize token lookup query" -t task -p 2

# Link the provenance
bd dep add auth-5 perf-99 --type discovered-from

# Now close original
bd close auth-5 --reason "OAuth refresh implemented. Discovered perf optimization needed (filed perf-99)."
```

**Why link with discovered-from**: Preserves the context of how you found the new work. Future you will appreciate knowing it came from the auth implementation.
