# discovery

Full discovery phase orchestrator. Brainstorm + ao search + research + plan + pre-mortem gate. Produces epic-id and execution-packet for $crank. Triggers: "discovery", "discover", "explore and plan", "research and plan", "discovery phase".

## Codex Execution Profile

1. Load and follow the skill instructions from the sibling `SKILL.md` file for
   this skill.
2. In Codex hookless mode, run `ao codex ensure-start` before discovery begins;
   the CLI records startup once per thread and skips duplicates automatically.

## Guardrails

1. Do not assume startup hooks exist under `~/.codex`.
2. Let closeout skills own `ao codex ensure-stop`; `$discovery` is a start-path skill.
3. Read local files in `references/` and `scripts/` only when needed.
