## Downstream Correlation

### In $vibe (Step 3.6)

When a pre-mortem report exists for the current epic:
1. Load prediction IDs from the most recent pre-mortem report
2. For each vibe finding, check if it matches a pre-mortem prediction
3. Tag matched findings with the prediction ID: `predicted_by: pm-20260312-001`
4. Tag unmatched findings as: `predicted_by: none` (surprise issue)

### In $post-mortem (Phase 2)

Add "Prediction Accuracy" section to the report:

```markdown
## Prediction Accuracy

| Prediction ID | Predicted | Actual | Hit? |
|---------------|-----------|--------|------|
| pm-20260312-001 | Registry write race | No race detected | MISS |
| pm-20260312-002 | Commit advisor creep | Advisor stayed suggestion-only | MISS |
| — | — | Vibe found missing test | SURPRISE |

**Accuracy: 0/2 predictions confirmed (0%). 1 surprise issue.**
```

## Accuracy Scoring

- **HIT**: Pre-mortem prediction matched an actual vibe/implementation finding
- **MISS**: Pre-mortem prediction did not materialize
- **SURPRISE**: Actual issue that no pre-mortem prediction covered

High miss rate is acceptable — pre-mortem is precautionary. High surprise rate suggests pre-mortem perspectives need expansion.
