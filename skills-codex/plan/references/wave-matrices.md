## File-Level Dependency Matrix (Mandatory)

Before assigning issues to waves, build a file-conflict matrix. For EACH issue, list every touched file it modifies or regenerates, not just the primary source files. The inventory must include tests, docs, schemas, fixtures, runtime copies, generated references, parity manifests, hash markers, lockfiles, and other generated artifacts. If an exact generated path is not known yet, assign the smallest owning glob to the issue and replace it with concrete paths before worker dispatch.

If any file appears in 2+ same-wave issues, either:
- **Serialize** them (move one to a later wave), or
- **Merge** them into a single issue assigned to one worker.

```markdown
## File-Conflict Matrix

| File | Issues |
|------|--------|
| `src/auth.go` | Issue 1, Issue 3 | ← CONFLICT: serialize or merge
| `src/config.go` | Issue 2 |
| `src/auth_test.go` | Issue 1 |
```

**Why:** Issue-level dependency graphs miss shared-file conflicts. In context-orchestration-leverage, two tracks both modified `rpi_phased_handoff.go` and required an unplanned Wave 2a/2b split. A file-conflict matrix would have caught this during planning.

## Cross-Wave Shared File Registry (Mandatory)

After computing waves, build a **cross-wave file registry** listing every file that appears in issues across different waves. These files are collision risks because later-wave worktrees are created from a base SHA that may not include earlier-wave changes.

```markdown
## Cross-Wave Shared Files

| File | Wave 1 Issues | Wave 2+ Issues | Mitigation |
|------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| `src/auth_test.go` | Issue 1 | Issue 5 | Wave 2 worktree must branch from post-Wave-1 SHA |
| `src/config.go` | Issue 2 | Issue 6 | Serial: Issue 6 blocked by Issue 2 |
```

**If any file appears in multiple waves:**
1. Ensure the later-wave issue explicitly declares a dependency on the earlier-wave issue that touches the same file (so `bd dep add` / `addBlockedBy` is set).
2. Flag the file in the plan's `## Cross-Wave Shared Files` section so `$crank` can enforce worktree base refresh between waves.
3. For test files shared across waves, prefer splitting test additions into the same wave as the code they test — avoid a separate "test coverage" issue that touches files already modified in an earlier wave.

**Why:** In na-vs9, Wave 2 agents started from pre-Wave-1 SHA. A Wave 2 test coverage issue overwrote Wave 1's `.md→.json` fix in `rpi_phased_test.go` because the worktree didn't include Wave 1's commit. The cross-wave registry makes these collisions visible during planning.

## Generated Artifact Companion Scope

When a planned issue changes skill behavior, phrasing, orchestration, or UX under `skills/<name>/`, the same issue must explicitly plan the Codex runtime companion scope:

- `skills-codex/<name>/` when the checked-in Codex artifact needs a body/script/reference change.
- `skills-codex-overrides/<name>/` or `skills-codex-overrides/catalog.json` when the Codex-specific tailoring or treatment changes.
- `skills-codex/.agentops-manifest.json` and `skills-codex/<name>/.agentops-generated.json` when artifact hashes need refresh.

Record these files in the `## File-Conflict Matrix` with the source skill issue, not in a later generic cleanup wave. The issue's validation block must include:

```bash
bash scripts/refresh-codex-artifacts.sh --scope worktree
bash scripts/validate-codex-generated-artifacts.sh --scope worktree
bash scripts/audit-codex-parity.sh --skill <name>
```

If the skill behavior change definitely has no Codex-facing effect, write that as the matrix mitigation with evidence. Do not leave Codex artifact scope implicit.

## Validate Dependency Necessity

For EACH declared dependency, verify:
1. Does the blocked issue modify a file that the blocker also modifies? → **Keep**
2. Does the blocked issue read output produced by the blocker? → **Keep**
3. Is the dependency only logical ordering (e.g., "specs before roles")? → **Remove**

False dependencies reduce parallelism. Pre-mortem judges will also flag these. In ol-571, unnecessary serialization between independent spec rewrites was caught by pre-mortem.
