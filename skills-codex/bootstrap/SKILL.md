# $bootstrap (Codex Native)

> **Quick Ref:** One command to set up the full AgentOps product layer. Progressive -- bare repos get everything, existing repos fill gaps only.

**YOU MUST EXECUTE THIS WORKFLOW. Do not just describe it.**

## Quick Start

```
$bootstrap
```

That is it. One command. Every step below is idempotent -- existing artifacts are never overwritten.

## Flags

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--dry-run` | Report what would be created without doing anything |
| `--force` | Recreate artifacts even if they already exist |

## Execution Steps

### Step 0: Detect Repo State

```bash
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo "NOT_A_GIT_REPO"; exit 1; }
HAS_GOALS=$([[ -f GOALS.md ]] && echo true || echo false)
HAS_PRODUCT=$([[ -f PRODUCT.md ]] && echo true || echo false)
HAS_README=$([[ -f README.md ]] && echo true || echo false)
HAS_AGENTS=$([[ -d .agents ]] && echo true || echo false)
HAS_HOOKS=$(grep -rq "agentops" .git/hooks/ 2>/dev/null && echo true || echo false)
HAS_AO=$(command -v ao >/dev/null && echo true || echo false)
```

Classify the repo:

| State | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| **bare** | No GOALS.md, no PRODUCT.md, no .agents/ |
| **partial** | Some artifacts present, some missing |
| **complete** | All artifacts present |

If `--dry-run` is set: report the state and what would be created, then stop. Do not proceed to Steps 1-6.

If the repo is **complete** and `--force` is not set: report "Repo is fully bootstrapped. Nothing to do." and stop.

### Step 1: GOALS.md

If `HAS_GOALS` is false (or `--force` is set):

Run the goals initialization inline. Prompt the user for project purpose, key metrics, and initial directives. Write GOALS.md with:
- Mission statement
- Initial directives (3-5 recommended)
- Fitness thresholds

```bash
# Check if ao CLI is available for goals init
if command -v ao >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  ao goals init
else
  # Generate GOALS.md inline from user input
  echo "# Goals" > GOALS.md
  echo "" >> GOALS.md
  echo "## Mission" >> GOALS.md
  echo "<prompt user for mission>" >> GOALS.md
fi
```

If `HAS_GOALS` is true and `--force` is not set: skip. Report "GOALS.md exists -- skipped."

### Step 2: PRODUCT.md

If `HAS_PRODUCT` is false (or `--force` is set):

Run the product definition inline. Interview the user about mission, personas, value props, and competitive landscape. Write PRODUCT.md with filled-in sections.

If `HAS_PRODUCT` is true and `--force` is not set: skip. Report "PRODUCT.md exists -- skipped."

### Step 3: README.md

If `HAS_README` is false (or `--force` is set) AND PRODUCT.md now exists:

Generate README.md from PRODUCT.md content. Include: project name, description, installation, usage, contributing section.

If `HAS_README` is true and `--force` is not set: skip. Report "README.md exists -- skipped."

If PRODUCT.md does not exist (Step 2 was skipped or failed): skip. Report "README.md skipped -- PRODUCT.md required first."

### Step 4: .agents/ Structure

If `HAS_AGENTS` is false (or `--force` is set):

Create the directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/learnings .agents/council .agents/research .agents/plans .agents/rpi
```

Create `.agents/AGENTS.md` if it does not exist:

```markdown
# Agent Knowledge Store

This directory contains accumulated knowledge from agent sessions.

## Structure

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `learnings/` | Extracted lessons and patterns |
| `council/` | Council validation artifacts |
| `research/` | Research phase outputs |
| `plans/` | Implementation plans |
| `rpi/` | RPI execution packets and phase logs |

## Usage

Knowledge is automatically managed by the AgentOps flywheel:
- `$inject` surfaces relevant prior knowledge at session start
- `$post-mortem` extracts and processes new learnings
- `$compile` runs maintenance (mine, grow, defrag)
```

If `HAS_AGENTS` is true and `--force` is not set: skip. Report ".agents/ exists -- skipped."

### Step 5: Hook Activation

If `HAS_AO` is true AND `HAS_HOOKS` is false (or `--force` is set):

```bash
ao init --hooks
```

If `HAS_AO` is false: skip. Report "Hooks skipped -- ao CLI not installed. Run: brew tap boshu2/agentops https://github.com/boshu2/homebrew-agentops && brew install agentops"

If `HAS_HOOKS` is true and `--force` is not set: skip. Report "Hooks already configured -- skipped."

### Step 6: Report

Output a summary table:

```
Bootstrap complete.

| Artifact      | Status  |
|---------------|---------|
| GOALS.md      | created / skipped / failed |
| PRODUCT.md    | created / skipped / failed |
| README.md     | created / skipped / failed |
| .agents/      | created / skipped / failed |
| Hooks         | activated / skipped / failed |

Repo is now AgentOps-ready. Next: $rpi "your first goal"
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|---------|
| "Not a git repo" | No .git directory | Run `git init` first |
| Goals step fails | No project context | Provide a one-line project description when prompted |
| Product step fails | No goals defined | Run goals init manually first, then re-run `$bootstrap` |
| Hooks not activating | ao CLI not installed | Install: `brew tap boshu2/agentops https://github.com/boshu2/homebrew-agentops && brew install agentops` |
| Want to start over | Existing artifacts blocking | Use `--force` to recreate all artifacts |
