# Goals

The local DevOps layer for coding agents — skills, CLI, and knowledge flywheel that make every session smarter than the last.

## North Stars

- Skills work identically across Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, and OpenCode
- Knowledge captured in one session is retrieved and applied in the next
- A new user goes from install to first validated workflow in under 5 minutes

## Anti Stars

- Product promises with no automated verification
- Goals that measure code metrics instead of user outcomes
- Quarantined tests that hide real regression risk

## Directives

### 1. Close the multi-runtime promise gap

README and PRODUCT.md promise skills work across 4 runtimes, but runtime-specific tests are quarantined (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode all disabled in `tests/_quarantine/`). Only one cross-runtime test exists (`tests/codex/test-skill-cross-runtime.sh`). Ship at least 2 more runtime-specific smoke tests and promote them to CI.

**Progress:** One cross-runtime test (`tests/codex/test-skill-cross-runtime.sh`) exists and passes. Remaining gap: 2+ additional runtime smoke tests needed and promoted out of quarantine.

**Steer:** increase (runtime coverage count)

### 2. Gate the install path

Three install scripts (`install.sh`, `install-codex.sh`, `install-opencode.sh`) have zero automated testing. A broken install is the fastest way to lose a user. Add install-path smoke tests that verify each script produces a working skill set.

**Progress:** `install-smoke` gate added (`tests/install/test-install-smoke.sh`, weight 5) — validates syntax and structure of all install scripts. Gate is active in CI. Remaining gap: runtime execution tests (verify actual skill installation works end-to-end).

**Steer:** increase (install scripts with smoke tests)

### 3. Resurrect quarantined E2E tests

8 test directories sit disabled in `tests/_quarantine/` — RPI pipeline, skill triggering, native teams, runtime-specific tests. Each represents a real user workflow with no regression protection. Triage each: fix and promote, or delete if obsolete.

**Steer:** decrease (quarantined test count)

### 4. Verify knowledge lifecycle end-to-end

The flywheel-compounding gate proves σρ > δ (escape velocity). But the full lifecycle — capture quality, injection correctness, citation in downstream work — has no gate. Add a gate that traces one learning from extraction through injection to retrieval.

**Progress:** `flywheel-lifecycle` gate added (`scripts/check-flywheel-lifecycle.sh`, weight 6) — traces capture → index → inject → retrieval as a 4-stage pipeline check. Gate is active in CI. Remaining gap: citation in downstream work (stage 5) not yet gated.

**Steer:** increase (lifecycle stages gated)

### 5. Keep complexity regressions at zero

CC 20 ceiling was achieved. Gate enforces the threshold — the directive is to maintain zero violations and prevent future regressions via pre-commit checks.

**Steer:** decrease (functions exceeding CC 20)

### 6. Maintain competitive awareness

Competitive analysis docs (`docs/comparisons/vs-*.md`) must stay fresh. GSD, Compound Engineer, and sdd are actively iterating — stale analysis means blind spots. Refresh comparisons within 45 days of last update. `/evolve` picks this up automatically when other goals pass.

**Steer:** decrease (stale comparison doc count)

### 7. Enforce codex parity proactively

CI catches codex drift at push time, but 40% of fix commits in the March 2026 integration were codex parity issues caught too late. The PreToolUse hook warns during editing; the goal gate blocks push if drift exists.

**Steer:** decrease (codex parity findings count)

## Three-Gap Proof Surface

AgentOps closes three gaps that prevent coding agents from compounding. This section maps each gap to measurable gates so fitness checks can verify the claim is true, not just stated.

| Gap | Definition | Gate | Check |
|-----|-----------|------|-------|
| Judgment validation | Plans and code are reviewed before commit; regressions are blocked, not advised | `hook-preflight`, `go-cli-tests`, `go-complexity-ceiling` | All three must pass on every push |
| Durable learning | Knowledge captured in one session is retrievable and applied in the next; decay rate does not exceed usage | `flywheel-compounding` (σρ > δ), `flywheel-lifecycle` (capture → index → inject → retrieval) | Both gates must pass; lifecycle must trace ≥ 4 stages |
| Loop closure | Completed work feeds back into constraints and goals; every cycle produces better next work | `flywheel-proof`, `athena-freshness`, `athena-no-oscillation` | Proof passes, defrag report fresh, zero oscillating goals |

**Canonical reference:** `docs/context-lifecycle.md` — evidence map and mechanism inventory for all three gaps.

The three-gap contract is satisfied when all nine gates above pass simultaneously. `ao goals measure` checks this on demand.
