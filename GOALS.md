# Goals

The local DevOps layer for coding agents — skills, CLI, and knowledge flywheel that make every session smarter than the last.

## North Stars

- Skills work identically across Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, and OpenCode
- Knowledge captured in one session is retrieved and applied in the next
- A new user goes from install to first validated workflow in under 5 minutes

## Anti Stars

- Product promises with no automated verification
- Goals that measure code metrics instead of user outcomes
- Quarantined tests that hide real regression risk

## Directives

### 1. Close the multi-runtime promise gap

README and PRODUCT.md promise skills work across 4 runtimes, but runtime-specific tests are quarantined (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode all disabled in `tests/_quarantine/`). Only one cross-runtime test exists (`tests/codex/test-skill-cross-runtime.sh`). Ship at least 2 more runtime-specific smoke tests and promote them to CI.

**Progress:** One cross-runtime test (`tests/codex/test-skill-cross-runtime.sh`) exists and passes. Two additional runtime smoke tests promoted to CI: `tests/skills/test-runtime-opencode-smoke.sh` (OpenCode install script + skill structure) and `tests/skills/test-runtime-claude-code-smoke.sh` (Claude Code plugin manifest + hooks + frontmatter). Both are standalone — no live runtime required. Remaining gap: Codex CLI and live runtime execution tests still require external infrastructure.

**Steer:** increase (runtime coverage count)

### 2. Gate the install path

Three install scripts (`install.sh`, `install-codex.sh`, `install-opencode.sh`) have zero automated testing. A broken install is the fastest way to lose a user. Add install-path smoke tests that verify each script produces a working skill set.

**Progress:** `install-smoke` gate added (`tests/install/test-install-smoke.sh`, weight 5) — validates syntax and structure of all install scripts. Gate is active in CI. Runtime execution tests added: when a local `cli/bin/ao` binary exists, the gate now verifies `ao --version`, `ao help`, and that `flywheel`, `goals`, and `inject` subcommands are registered. Remaining gap: end-to-end install execution (running `scripts/install.sh` against a clean environment) requires a sandboxed CI environment with network access — documented as out-of-scope for local gate.

**Steer:** increase (install scripts with smoke tests)

### 3. Resurrect quarantined E2E tests

8 test directories sit disabled in `tests/_quarantine/` — RPI pipeline, skill triggering, native teams, runtime-specific tests. Each represents a real user workflow with no regression protection. Triage each: fix and promote, or delete if obsolete.

**Steer:** decrease (quarantined test count)

### 4. Verify knowledge lifecycle end-to-end

The flywheel-compounding gate proves σρ > δ (escape velocity). But the full lifecycle — capture quality, injection correctness, citation in downstream work — has no gate. Add a gate that traces one learning from extraction through injection to retrieval.

**Progress:** `flywheel-lifecycle` gate now traces 5 stages: capture → retrieval → inject → round-trip → citation (`scripts/check-flywheel-lifecycle.sh`). Stage 5 (citation) checks for cross-citations between learnings, briefings directory population, and corpus density. Citation checks are soft-fail on sparse corpus (structurally valid but no accumulated sessions yet) — they hard-fail only if the corpus is populated and citations are structurally absent. Gate is active in CI.

**Steer:** increase (lifecycle stages gated)

### 5. Keep complexity regressions at zero

CC 20 ceiling was achieved. Gate enforces the threshold — the directive is to maintain zero violations and prevent future regressions via pre-commit checks.

**Steer:** decrease (functions exceeding CC 20)

### 6. Maintain competitive awareness

Competitive analysis docs (`docs/comparisons/vs-*.md`) must stay fresh. GSD, Compound Engineer, and sdd are actively iterating — stale analysis means blind spots. Refresh comparisons within 45 days of last update. `/evolve` picks this up automatically when other goals pass.

**Steer:** decrease (stale comparison doc count)

### 7. Enforce codex parity proactively

CI catches codex drift at push time, but 40% of fix commits in the March 2026 integration were codex parity issues caught too late. The PreToolUse hook warns during editing; the goal gate blocks push if drift exists.

**Steer:** decrease (codex parity findings count)

## Three-Gap Contract Proof Surface

AgentOps defines a three-gap contract ([context lifecycle](docs/context-lifecycle.md)) covering the failure modes that persist after prompt construction and agent routing. Every gate below maps to at least one gap. If a gap has no gate, it is an unproven promise.

| Gap | What fails without it | Proving gates | Coverage |
|-----|-----------------------|---------------|----------|
| **1. Judgment validation** — agents ship without risk context | Plans skip architecture fit; implementations pass happy path but miss edge cases | `hook-preflight`, `go-vet-clean`, `go-complexity-ceiling`, `security-gate`, `wiring-closure`, `contract-compatibility` | Mechanically enforced via hooks and static analysis; `/pre-mortem` and `/vibe` supply the non-mechanical judgment layer |
| **2. Durable learning** — solved problems recur | Same auth bug fixed Monday returns Wednesday; agents re-run dead-end investigations | `flywheel-compounding`, `flywheel-proof`, `athena-freshness`, `athena-no-oscillation` | Flywheel escape velocity proves compounding; Athena gates prove curation and freshness |
| **3. Loop closure** — completed work doesn't produce better next work | Sessions end with diffs but no extracted lessons; next session starts cold | `flywheel-proof`, `goals-validate`, `wiring-closure`, `release-cadence` | `flywheel-proof` traces capture-to-retrieval; `goals-validate` ensures findings become directives; `wiring-closure` proves registries stay connected |

**Design rule:** prefer current gates over new scripts unless a true gap is found. New gates are justified only when a gap row shows no proving gate.

**Canonical reference:** `docs/context-lifecycle.md` — evidence map and mechanism inventory for all three gaps.

The three-gap contract is satisfied when the mapped gates below remain green together. `ao goals measure` checks the current set on demand.
