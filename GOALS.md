# Goals

The local DevOps layer for coding agents — skills, CLI, and knowledge flywheel that make every session smarter than the last.

## North Stars

- Skills work identically across Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, and OpenCode
- Knowledge captured in one session is retrieved and applied in the next
- A new user goes from install to first validated workflow in under 5 minutes

## Anti Stars

- Product promises with no automated verification
- Goals that measure code metrics instead of user outcomes
- Quarantined tests that hide real regression risk

## Directives

### 1. Close the multi-runtime promise gap

README and PRODUCT.md promise skills work across 4 runtimes, but runtime-specific tests are quarantined (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode all disabled in `tests/_quarantine/`). Only one cross-runtime test exists (`tests/codex/test-skill-cross-runtime.sh`). Ship at least 2 more runtime-specific smoke tests and promote them to CI.

**Steer:** increase (runtime coverage count)

### 2. Gate the install path

Three install scripts (`install.sh`, `install-codex.sh`, `install-opencode.sh`) have zero automated testing. A broken install is the fastest way to lose a user. Add install-path smoke tests that verify each script produces a working skill set.

**Steer:** increase (install scripts with smoke tests)

### 3. Resurrect quarantined E2E tests

8 test directories sit disabled in `tests/_quarantine/` — RPI pipeline, skill triggering, native teams, runtime-specific tests. Each represents a real user workflow with no regression protection. Triage each: fix and promote, or delete if obsolete.

**Steer:** decrease (quarantined test count)

### 4. Verify knowledge lifecycle end-to-end

The flywheel-compounding gate proves σρ > δ (escape velocity). But the full lifecycle — capture quality, injection correctness, citation in downstream work — has no gate. Add a gate that traces one learning from extraction through injection to retrieval.

**Steer:** increase (lifecycle stages gated)

### 5. Keep complexity regressions at zero

CC 20 ceiling was achieved. Gate enforces the threshold — the directive is to maintain zero violations and prevent future regressions via pre-commit checks.

**Steer:** decrease (functions exceeding CC 20)
