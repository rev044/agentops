### The local DevOps layer for coding agents.

AgentOps is the operating system around your coding agent: it tracks the work, validates the plan and code, and feeds what was learned into the next session.

## Why AgentOps Exists

Most coding-agent tools improve the session. AgentOps improves the repo around the session.

**Your agent remembers what worked.** Every session writes decisions, patterns, and learnings to `.agents/` — git-tracked, auditable, diffable. Not opaque SQLite. Not vector embeddings on someone else's server. Plain files that compound across sessions and transfer between machines with `git clone`.

**Your code reviewed by Claude AND GPT.** `/council` spawns independent judges across vendors — no anchoring, no single-model blind spots. The only plugin that does cross-vendor consensus validation.

| Without AgentOps | With AgentOps |
|------------------|---------------|
| Partial memory each session | Repo-native memory via `.agents/` — retrieval, freshness weighting, injection |
| Review after the fact | `/pre-mortem` before build, `/vibe` before commit |
| Untracked agent runs | Issues, dependency waves, worktrees, audit trails |
| Chat logs | Artifacts the next session can use |

---

## Install

```bash
# Claude Code (recommended): marketplace + plugin install
claude plugin marketplace add boshu2/agentops
claude plugin install agentops@agentops-marketplace

# Codex CLI (0.110.0+ native plugin; installs the native plugin, archives stale raw mirrors if needed, then open a fresh Codex session)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boshu2/agentops/main/scripts/install-codex.sh | bash

# OpenCode
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boshu2/agentops/main/scripts/install-opencode.sh | bash

# Other Skills-compatible agents (agent-specific, install only what you need)
# Example (Cursor):
npx skills@latest add boshu2/agentops --cursor -g
```

### Install ao CLI (optional)

Skills work standalone — no CLI required. The `ao` CLI is what unlocks the full repo-native layer: knowledge extraction, retrieval and injection, maturity scoring, goals, and control-plane style workflows.

#### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew tap boshu2/agentops https://github.com/boshu2/homebrew-agentops
brew install agentops
which ao
ao version
```

Or install via [release binaries](https://github.com/boshu2/agentops/releases) or [build from source](cli/README.md).

Then type `/quickstart` in your agent chat.

---

## Start Here

Three commands, zero methodology. Pick one and go:

```bash
/council validate this PR          # Multi-model code review — immediate value
/research "how does auth work"     # Codebase exploration with memory
/implement "fix the login bug"     # Full lifecycle for one task
```

When you're ready for more:

```bash
/plan → /crank                     # Decompose into issues, parallel-execute
/rpi "add retry backoff"           # Full pipeline: research → plan → build → validate → learn
/evolve                            # Fitness-scored improvement loop — walk away, come back to better code
```

Every skill works alone. Compose them however you want. Full catalog: [Skills](#skills).

---

## How It Works

A phased lifecycle, not a bag of prompts:

| Phase | Primary skills | What gets locked in |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| Discovery | `/brainstorm` -> `/research` -> `/plan` -> `/pre-mortem` | repo context, scoped work, known risks, execution packet |
| Implementation | `/crank` -> `/swarm` -> `/implement` | closed issues, validated wave outputs, ratchet checkpoints |
| Validation + learning | `/validation` -> `/vibe` -> `/post-mortem` -> `/retro` -> `/forge` | findings, learnings, next work, stronger prevention artifacts |

`/rpi` orchestrates all three phases. `/evolve` keeps running `/rpi` against `GOALS.md` so the worst fitness gap gets addressed next. The output is not just code — it is code + state + memory + gates.

| Pattern | Chain | When |
|---------|-------|------|
| **Quick fix** | `/implement` | One issue, clear scope |
| **Validated fix** | `/implement` → `/vibe` | One issue, want confidence |
| **Planned epic** | `/plan` → `/pre-mortem` → `/crank` → `/post-mortem` | Multi-issue, structured |
| **Full pipeline** | `/rpi` (chains all above) | End-to-end, autonomous |
| **Evolve loop** | `/evolve` (chains `/rpi` repeatedly) | Fitness-scored improvement |
| **PR contribution** | `/pr-research` → `/pr-plan` → `/pr-implement` → `/pr-validate` → `/pr-prep` | External repo |
| **Knowledge query** | `ao search` → `/research` (if gaps) | Understanding before building |
| **Standalone review** | `/council validate <target>` | Ad-hoc multi-judge review |

### Primitive chains underneath it

- **Mission and fitness**: `GOALS.md`, `ao goals`, `/evolve`
- **Discovery chain**: `/brainstorm` -> `ao search` / `ao lookup` -> `/research` -> `/plan` -> `/pre-mortem`
- **Execution chain**: `/crank` -> `/swarm` -> `/implement` -> `/vibe` -> ratchet checkpoints
- **Compiled prevention chain**: findings registry -> planning rules / pre-mortem checks / constraints -> later planning and validation
- **Continuity chain**: session hooks + phased manifests + `/handoff` + `/recover`

That is the real architecture: a local operating layer around the agent, not just a prompt pack. See [Primitive Chains](docs/architecture/primitive-chains.md) for the audited map.

### The Knowledge Flywheel

Each session automatically extracts knowledge and feeds it back — making the next session smarter:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     THE KNOWLEDGE FLYWHEEL                            │

│  Each citation feeds back: utility scores update, high-utility        │
│  knowledge surfaces more often, low-utility decays. This is the       │
│  compounding effect — sessions get smarter because the best           │
│  knowledge rises and the noise sinks.                                 │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Forge** extracts decisions, solutions, learnings, and failures from every session. **Pool** scores each on specificity, actionability, and novelty. **Promote** graduates the best after another session cites it. **Inject** surfaces the top knowledge at session start — each retrieval creates a citation that drives the feedback loop.

```text
> /research "retry backoff strategies"

[lookup] 3 prior learnings found (freshness-weighted):
  - Token bucket with Redis (established, high confidence)
  - Rate limit at middleware layer, not per-handler (pattern)
  - /login endpoint was missing rate limiting (decision)
[research] Found prior art in your codebase + retrieved context
           Recommends: exponential backoff with jitter, reuse existing Redis client
```

Session 50 starts with 50 sessions of accumulated wisdom — not from scratch. Stale insights [decay automatically](docs/the-science.md). Useful ones compound. Measure it: `ao flywheel status`.

Deep dive: [The Knowledge Flywheel](docs/knowledge-flywheel.md)

### Why engineers buy in

- **Local-only** — no telemetry, no cloud, no accounts. Nothing phones home.
- **Auditable** — plans, verdicts, learnings, and patterns are plain files on disk.
- **Multi-runtime** — Claude Code and Codex CLI (first-class), Cursor and OpenCode (experimental).
- **Harder to drift** — tracked issues and validation gates mean the repo is less dependent on agent mood or memory.

Everything is [open source](cli/) — audit it yourself.

<details>
<summary><b>OpenCode</b> — plugin + skills</summary>

Installs 7 hooks (tool enrichment, audit logging, compaction resilience) and symlinks all skills. Restart OpenCode after install. Details: [.opencode/INSTALL.md](.opencode/INSTALL.md)

<details>
<summary><b>Configuration</b> — environment variables</summary>

All optional. AgentOps works out of the box with no configuration. Full reference: [docs/ENV-VARS.md](docs/ENV-VARS.md)

**What AgentOps touches:**

| What | Where | Reversible? |

## See It Work

**1. One command** — validate a PR:

```text
> /council validate this PR

[council] 3 judges spawned (independent, no anchoring)
[judge-1] PASS — token bucket implementation correct
[judge-2] WARN — rate limiting missing on /login endpoint
[judge-3] PASS — Redis integration follows middleware pattern
Consensus: WARN — add rate limiting to /login before shipping
```

**2. Full pipeline** — research through post-mortem, one command:

```text
> /rpi "add retry backoff to rate limiter"

[research]    Found 3 prior learnings on rate limiting (injected)
[plan]        2 issues, 1 wave → epic ag-0058
[pre-mortem]  Council validates plan → PASS (knew about Redis choice)
[crank]       Parallel agents: Wave 1 ██ 2/2
[vibe]        Council validates code → PASS
[post-mortem] 2 new learnings → .agents/
[flywheel]    Next: /rpi "add circuit breaker to external API calls"
```

**3. The endgame** — `/evolve`: define goals, walk away, come back to a better codebase:

```text
> /evolve

[evolve] GOALS.md: 18 gates loaded, score 77.0% (14/18 passing)

[cycle-1]     Worst: wiring-closure (weight 6) + 3 more
              /rpi "Fix failing goals" → score 93.3% (25/28) ✓

              ── the agent naturally organizes into phases ──

[cycle-2-35]  Coverage blitz: 17 packages from ~85% → ~97% avg
              Table-driven tests, edge cases, error paths
[cycle-38-59] Benchmarks added to all 15 internal packages
[cycle-60-95] Complexity annihilation: zero functions >= 8
              (was dozens >= 20 — extracted helpers, tested independently)
[cycle-96-116] Modernization: sentinel errors, exhaustive switches,
              Go 1.26-compatible idioms (slices, cmp.Or, range-over-int)

[teardown]    203 files changed, 20K+ lines, 116 cycles
              All tests pass. Go vet clean. Avg coverage 97%.
              /post-mortem → 33 learnings extracted
              Ready for next /evolve — the floor is now the ceiling.
```

That ran overnight — ~7 hours, unattended. Regression gates auto-reverted anything that broke a passing goal. The agent naturally organized into the right order: build a safety net (tests), refactor aggressively (complexity), then polish.

<details>
<summary><b>More examples</b> — swarm, session continuity, different workflows</summary>

<br>

**Parallelize anything** with `/swarm`:

```text
> /swarm "research auth patterns, brainstorm rate limiting improvements"

[swarm] 3 agents spawned — each gets fresh context
[agent-1] /research auth — found JWT + session patterns, 2 prior learnings
[agent-2] /research rate-limiting — found token bucket, middleware pattern
[agent-3] /brainstorm improvements — 4 approaches ranked
[swarm] Complete — artifacts in .agents/
```

**Session continuity across compaction or restart:**
```text
> /handoff
[handoff] Saved: 3 open issues, current branch, next action
         Continuation prompt written to .agents/handoffs/

--- next session ---

> /recover
[recover] Found in-progress epic ag-0058 (2/5 issues closed)
          Branch: feature/rate-limiter
          Next: /implement ag-0058.3
```

**Different developers, different setups:**

| Workflow | Commands | What happens |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **PR reviewer** | `/council validate this PR` | One command, actionable feedback, no setup |
| **Team lead** | `/research` → `/plan` → `/council validate` | Compose skills manually, stay in control |
| **Solo dev** | `/rpi "add user auth"` | Research through post-mortem, walk away |
| **Platform team** | `/swarm` + `/evolve` | Parallel pipelines + fitness-scored improvement loop |

## Skills

Every skill works alone. Compose them however you want.

**Core skills** — where most users spend their time:

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/council` | Independent judges (Claude + Codex) debate, surface disagreement, converge. The validation primitive everything else builds on. |
| `/research` | Deep codebase exploration — produces structured findings with memory |
| `/implement` | Full lifecycle for one task — research, plan, build, validate, learn |
| `/vibe` | Code quality review — complexity + multi-model council + domain checklists |
| `/evolve` | Measure goals, fix the worst gap, regression-gate everything, repeat overnight |

**Full catalog:**

<details>
<summary><b>Judgment</b> — the foundation everything validates against</summary>

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/council` | Independent judges (Claude + Codex) debate, surface disagreement, converge. Auto-extracts findings into flywheel. `--preset=security-audit`, `--perspectives`, `--debate` |
| `/vibe` | Code quality review — complexity + council + finding classification (CRITICAL vs INFORMATIONAL) + suppression framework + domain checklists (SQL, LLM, concurrency) |
| `/pre-mortem` | Validate plans — error/rescue mapping, scope modes (Expand/Hold/Reduce), temporal interrogation, prediction tracking with downstream correlation |
| `/post-mortem` | Wrap up work — council validates, prediction accuracy scoring (HIT/MISS/SURPRISE), session streak tracking, persistent retro history |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Execution</b> — research, plan, build, ship</summary>

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/research` | Deep codebase exploration — produces structured findings |
| `/plan` | Decompose a goal into trackable issues with dependency waves |
| `/implement` | Full lifecycle for one task — research, plan, build, validate, learn |
| `/crank` | Parallel agents in dependency-ordered waves, fresh context per worker |
| `/swarm` | Parallelize any skill — run research, brainstorms, implementations in parallel |
| `/rpi` | Full pipeline: discovery (research + plan + pre-mortem) → implementation (crank) → validation (vibe + post-mortem) |
| `/evolve` | The endgame: measure goals, fix the worst gap, regression-gate everything, learn, repeat overnight |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Knowledge</b> — the flywheel that makes sessions compound</summary>

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/retro` | Capture a decision, pattern, or lesson learned |
| `/forge` | Extract learnings from completed work into `.agents/` |
| `/flywheel` | Monitor knowledge health — velocity, staleness, pool depths |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Supporting skills</b> — onboarding, session, traceability, product, utility</summary>

| | |
|---|---|
| **Onboarding** | `/quickstart`, `/using-agentops` |
| **Session** | `/handoff`, `/recover`, `/status` |
| **Traceability** | `/trace`, `/provenance` |
| **Product** | `/product`, `/goals`, `/release`, `/readme`, `/doc` |
| **Utility** | `/brainstorm`, `/bug-hunt`, `/complexity` |

</details>

Full reference: [docs/SKILLS.md](docs/SKILLS.md)

<details>
<summary><b>Cross-runtime orchestration</b> — mix Claude, Codex, OpenCode</summary>

AgentOps orchestrates across runtimes. Claude can lead a team of Codex workers. Codex judges can review Claude's output.

| Spawning Backend | How it works | Best for |
|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| **Native teams** | `TeamCreate` + `SendMessage` — built into Claude Code | Tight coordination, debate |
| **Background tasks** | `Task(run_in_background=true)` — last-resort fallback | When no team APIs available |
| **Codex sub-agents** | `/codex-team` — Claude orchestrates Codex workers | Cross-vendor validation |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Custom agents</b> — why AgentOps ships its own</summary>

Two read-only agents fill the gap between Claude Code's `Explore` (no commands) and `general-purpose` (full write, expensive):

| Agent | Model | Can do | Can't do |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|
| `agentops:researcher` | haiku | Read, search, run commands | Write or edit files |
| `agentops:code-reviewer` | sonnet | Read, search, `git diff`, structured findings | Write or edit files |

Skills spawn these automatically — `/research` uses the researcher, `/vibe` uses the code-reviewer.

</details>

## Deep Dive

`.agents/` is an append-only ledger — every learning, verdict, pattern, and decision is a dated file. Write once, score by freshness, inject the best, prune the rest. The [formal model](docs/the-science.md) is cache eviction with freshness decay. Full lifecycle: [Context Lifecycle](docs/context-lifecycle.md).

<details>
<summary><b>Phase details</b> — what each step does</summary>

1. **`/research`** — Explores your codebase. Produces a research artifact with findings and recommendations.

2. **`/plan`** — Decomposes the goal into issues with dependency waves. Creates a [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) epic (git-native issue tracking).

3. **`/pre-mortem`** — Judges simulate failures before you write code. FAIL? Re-plan with feedback (max 3 retries).

4. **`/crank`** — Spawns parallel agents in dependency-ordered waves. Each worker gets fresh context. Lead validates and commits. `--test-first` for spec-first TDD.

5. **`/vibe`** — Judges validate the code. FAIL? Re-crank with failure context and re-vibe (max 3).

6. **`/post-mortem`** — Council validates the implementation. Retro extracts learnings. **Suggests the next `/rpi` command.**

`/rpi "goal"` runs all six end to end. Use `--interactive` for human gates at research and plan.

## The `ao` CLI

The `ao` CLI adds the knowledge flywheel (extract, inject, decay, maturity) and terminal-based RPI that runs without an active chat session.

```bash
ao seed                                        # Plant AgentOps in any repo (auto-detects project type)
ao rpi loop --supervisor --max-cycles 1        # Canonical autonomous cycle (policy-gated landing)
ao rpi loop --supervisor "fix auth bug"        # Single explicit-goal supervised cycle
ao rpi phased --from=implementation "ag-058"   # Resume a specific phased run at build phase
ao rpi parallel --manifest epics.json          # Run N epics concurrently in isolated worktrees
ao rpi status --watch                          # Monitor active/terminal runs
```

Walk away, come back to committed code + extracted learnings.

```bash
ao search "query"              # Search knowledge across files and chat history
ao lookup --query "topic"      # Retrieve specific knowledge artifacts by ID or relevance
ao notebook update             # Merge latest session insights into MEMORY.md
ao memory sync                 # Sync session history to MEMORY.md (cross-runtime: Codex, OpenCode)
ao context assemble            # Build 5-section context briefing for a task
ao feedback-loop               # Close the MemRL feedback loop (citation → utility → maturity)
ao metrics health              # Flywheel health: sigma, rho, delta, escape velocity
ao dedup                       # Detect near-duplicate learnings (--merge for auto-resolution)
ao contradict                  # Detect potentially contradictory learnings
ao demo                        # Interactive demo
```

`ao search` (built on [CASS](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search)) indexes every chat session from every runtime that writes to `.agents/ao/sessions/`.

<details>
<summary><b>Second Brain + Obsidian vault</b> — semantic search over all your sessions</summary>

`.agents/` is plain text — open it as an Obsidian vault for browsing and linking. For semantic search, pair with [Smart Connections](https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections) (local embeddings, MCP server for agent retrieval).

## Architecture

One recursive shape at every scale:

```
/implement ── one worker, one issue, one verify cycle
    └── /crank ── waves of /implement (FIRE loop)
        └── /rpi ── research → plan → crank → validate → learn
            └── /evolve ── fitness-gated /rpi cycles
```

Each level treats the one below as a black box: spec in, validated result out. Workers get fresh context per wave ([Ralph Wiggum Pattern](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/)), never commit (lead-only), and communicate through the filesystem. Orchestrators stay in the main session; workers fork into subagents. See [`SKILL-TIERS.md`](skills/SKILL-TIERS.md) for the full classification.
